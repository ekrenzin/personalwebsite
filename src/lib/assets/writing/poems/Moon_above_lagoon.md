## Moon above Lagoon and Lune

In all my life 
I desired for Dignity.
I have believed it to be
Something achieved,
Itâ€™s not earned.

From a young age, I have been a contrarian. I catch myself arguing for the sake of argument. I derive no pleasure in this compulsion, yet I am the moon, not la lune. Perhaps it is from English I cycle, or perhaps my passion is an observation of the stars, that ambition to exist as more than a clever being on a speck of space dust. However, Argument inevitably guides us to isolation. Whatever the reason, today, I envy la lune, and her serene reflection against the waves. A reflection will always have a companion in her mirror.
