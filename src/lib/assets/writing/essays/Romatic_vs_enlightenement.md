## Enlightenment vs Romanticism 

### Prompt:
The Enlightenment and the Romantic Movement in most ways can be seen as in opposition to each other. Nonetheless, they have both had a huge influence on modern Western civilization. Which one do you think has had the most positive influence in the modern world (meaning from the 18th century to the present)?

### Essay:
The Enlightenment and the Romantic movement can be seen as in opposition to each other. The Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason took place in Europe and North America during the late 17th and early to mid 18th centuries. The Romantic movement, also known as Romanticism, originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century in response to the Enlightenment. Both the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement had tremendous cultural impacts. The Romantic movement focused on emotion and individualism, and The Enlightenment on reason and science. The Enlightenment transitioned away from individual bias and opinions to a purpose-driven, “general will” society. The Romantic movement looked for God in the natural world, embracing the juxtaposition of man and nature. Essentially, these movements strove to answer different questions: How versus Why. Ultimately, as with any political or cultural movement, there were positive and negative elements of each movement. In totality, from a utilitarianist perspective, the Enlightenment has (eventually) manifested into more impactful positives in modern society. The Romantic movement, while beautiful, has become obstructive in our post-modern society. Furthermore, the birth of nihilism and postmodernism in Nietzsche, and in legendary authors such as Cormac McCarthy reflect that as a society, we are rejecting the type of individualism from the Romantic movement in literature, or at least moving past it. Today, society appears to transition further down The Road to a post-humanist society, as reflected and glorified in Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto. Despite the profound cultural influence of both movements, the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, communal progress, and science, has had more impacts on our society. The Romantic movement's championing of emotion, individualism, and religious freedom, contributed to personal liberties and expressions. However, the world is entering an increasingly interconnected and technologically advanced era. The isolated man of the Romantic movement has been murdered. Therefore, the Enlightenment, due to its foundationally practical principles that continue to shape our approach to knowledge, governance, and societal progression, can be seen as having had more positive, active, influences on the modern world – even if it has also had more negative influence.

Having argued that the Romantic movement is dead today, I want to complicate the point by acknowledging that our current society reflects positive romantic individualism more prominently and productively than ever through personal liberty and expression. Consider the literal (gender) transition to a society that is more fluid, and flexible. Or the legalization of marriage for all sexualities. These are all positive examples that can be seen as derivatives of the Romantic movement. With that said, today we reflect a rejection of the individualism of the Romantic movement, rather than an embracing of it. Modern individualism - as exemplified by social media platforms - focuses on the communal validation of individual experiences, expressions, and identities. It's a form of individualism that seeks recognition and acceptance within a collective, rather than the Romantic individual who often stands in conflict with or apart from the collective. Even individualism has become communalism. The Romantic explorer simply lacks the firepower to contend with the artillery of the Enlightenment. Perhaps the movement died on the battlefield of World War I, in the clouds of gas suffocating the trenches, or when the English horses crumpled to the crossfire of the German machine guns. No individual can stand against the machine. 

With that said, the Enlightenment movement was not entirely negative. The Enlightenment was an embrace of individual liberty, advocating for “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness”. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s influential work, "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men" (1754), he introduced the concept of the "general will." According to Rousseau this represented the collective desires and interests of the community, surpassing the individual wills of its members. I would contend that the legalizing of gay marriage is not the will of individuals, but is the general will of the populace, expressing our collective desire for a freer, more diverse, and equal society. Enlightenment concepts of personal freedom, equality, and the "general will" resonate within our democratic societies. We push for social and economic justice, environmental responsibility, and human rights. These are fundamentally Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing reason, equality, and liberty. 

In contrast, the Romantic movement, focusing on emotion and individualism, has left a complex legacy. Romantic idealization of individual feelings over societal norms has sometimes manifested in less desirable ways. The modern 'romantic' individual, once an explorer and muse of the natural world, exists instead as violent keyboard warrior. LARPing as Romantic: a caricature. These people represent the antithesis of the original Romantic movement and are a total perversion. In the age of social media, where individual views can be amplified to echo in chambers across the globe, Romantic individualism is now frequently misappropriated to oppose societal advancement. 

To clarify, my argument is not to say that the Romantic movement was negative, but rather that the current influence of the Romantic movement is largely negative. In contrast, the Enlightenment continues to fund (literally) research toward making the world a better place. Enlightenment is the electricity that lights the road and acts as a path forward. Many of life’s difficulties have been resolved, reflected in our exploding population. The human species is thriving. 

Donna Haraway's work, particularly her “A Cyborg Manifesto,” highlights our transition from a Romantic to a postmodern perspective. Haraway uses the cyborg metaphor to critique rigid identity categories, advocating for a more fluid understanding of the self that allows for greater diversity and inclusivity. In Haraway's perspective, the cyborg disrupts the established order. This isn't about eliminating individual responsibilities, but rather breaking down restrictive boundaries — like those between human and machine, nature and culture, male and female. Through this lens, the traditional restrictions imposed on women, exemplified in works such as Amy Lowell’s "Patterns" (1915), can be deconstructed. Haraway's goal is not the enforcement of a "general will," but the liberation of women and minorities from oppressive societal structures, enabling them to define their identities. Ironically, while Haraway's and other postmodernist thinkers’ advocacy for individual self-definition and liberation from societal constructs might seem to align with the Romantic movement's idealization of individualism and emotional authenticity, it's fundamentally different in critical ways. The Romantics typically idealized a return to nature and prized a sense of organic unity, often highlighting the distinct individual as a vital part of a larger, harmonious whole. Their work was often characterized by a revolt against the Enlightenment's strict rationality and an emphasis on emotion, intuition, and the primacy of the individual. In contrast, Haraway's work is not about embracing organic unity or a return to a more 'natural' state, but about moving beyond the traditional binaries and rigid categories that have long defined our understanding of identity. It's a postmodern approach that embraces hybridity, fluidity, and multiplicity, where identities and nature are not fixed by God but constructed and reconstructed by mankind. Haraway's idea of the cyborg rejects the Romantic's traditional dichotomies of nature versus culture and emotion versus reason. The cyborg, a fusion of organism and machine, represents a challenge to these dualistic ways of thinking. In this sense, while Haraway and the Romantics may both promote a form of individualism, they do so in fundamentally different ways, making Haraway's approach not an extension but rather a rejection of Romantic ideals. In this light, we can see that modern Gender and Sexuality progressives reject Romantic ideas. 
In conclusion, while both the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement have shaped modern western civilization, the principles of the Enlightenment have had a more lasting impacts, ultimately equating to more positives. The Enlightenment's focus on reason, communal progress, and science has underpinned our approach to governance, societal progression, and knowledge. Meanwhile, the Romantic movement's championing of individualism and emotion has been recontextualized and perverted within a communal framework. As we navigate an interconnected and technologically advanced world, it's the Enlightenment's focus on reason and progress that continues to guide us, showing the Enlightenment's enduring and critical influence on our modern world.

To conclude, I would simply note that the question is not whether the Romantic movement is in totality positive or negative but simply which one was more positive. The influence of The Enlightenment is an order of magnitude larger than that of the Romantic Movement. It’s nonsensical to contend that a movement born after the founding of the United States, could ever contend with the influence that led to the creation of the United States – and many other governments. 

Ultimately almost everything is a result of the Enlightenment. Its impact is so vast, so omnipresent, it is fundamentally impossible to argue against it. I specifically utilize the visual metaphor of horses being mowed down to highlight the futility of the Romantic movement in standing against the literal tanks and guns of the Enlightenment. This is not to say that the Romantic movement is inferior to the Enlightenment, but rather that it is microscopic. The Romantic movement, while influential, lacks the global scale of the Enlightenment which inspired revolutions and change across the globe.
