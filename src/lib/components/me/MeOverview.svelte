                Even though I'm an engineer, I started working as a graphic
                designer in New York City. I loved designing, but I felt like
                something was missing. I wanted to be able to create my own tools,
                I wanted to feel like a craftsman.
                <i>I needed to innovate.</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                So I learned how to code. Every night after getting home from my long
                shift, I would study code until extremely late into the
                night. I was practically working two full-time jobs, but coding
                never felt like a burden. My efforts were validated when I was
                promoted to an iOS developer within the company. I'm obsessed with
                code now, but my experience designing continues to provide value.
                The struggles from when I started, continue to motivate me to push
                forward and never slow down.
  
                <br />
                <br />
  
                I'm still completely passionate about software, although now I'm
                more focused on breaking into specific fields. Something about
                virtual reality <i>exhilarates</i> me. I love spinning up the
                headset and interacting with the things I code. Perhaps it's the
                itch that drove me to start finally getting a good scratch.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have over 5 years of industry experience in a myriad of
                languages on various platforms. It's been a long road, but I think
                the imposter syndrome is finally fading.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, I live with my fianc√© in the beautiful state of California with my
                happy dog, and smug cat. I enjoy running daily in the california costal trails,
                but often make trips to hike in the mountains, especially Yosemite.
                I enjoy travel & adventure, especially in foreign countries. I'm always looking for
                new places to explore, and new things to learn.
