                My journey began in New York City's graphic design scene, where I quickly found a passion for creativity. However, I aimed higher—I wanted to build the tools I used, leading me to transition into software engineering. 
                <i>Innovation became my driving force.</i>
                <br /><br />
                Committed to mastering coding skills in my spare time, I soon advanced to an iOS developer role within the same company. My design roots continue to enrich my software solutions, blending aesthetics with functionality.
                <br /><br />
                Now, I specialize in emerging technologies like virtual reality. The hands-on experience of shaping this technology is a constant source of excitement.
                <i>It's as if I've finally found the missing piece.</i>
                <br /><br />
                Nearly a decade in, spanning various platforms and languages, my initial doubts have given way to confidence.
                <br /><br />
                I live in scenic California with my fiancé and our pets. My life outside of work includes daily runs on California's trails, global travel, and a commitment to continuous learning.
                <i>I'm always looking for the next challenge.</i>
