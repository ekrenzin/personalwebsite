                Originating in graphic design roles in New York City, I was quickly captivated by the creative process. However, I aspired to transcend design limitations by developing the very tools I employed—a desire that led me into software engineering. 
                <i>An aspiration to innovate compelled me.</i>
                <br /><br />
                Committing to rigorous self-study post-working hours, I rapidly acquired coding proficiency. This endeavor culminated in my elevation to an iOS developer role within the same company. My design background continues to infuse my development work, adding a unique blend of aesthetic and functional insight.
                <br /><br />
                Currently, I am engrossed in specialized software domains, particularly virtual reality. The visceral engagement of this technology, experienced through the very code I write, serves as an ongoing source of exhilaration.
                <i>It feels like scratching a long-standing itch.</i>
                <br /><br />
                With nearly a decade in the industry, traversing multiple languages and platforms, the vestiges of imposter syndrome have begun to dissipate. 
                <br /><br />
                I reside in scenic California with my fiancé, our joyful dog, and complacent cat. My personal pursuits include daily runs along Californian trails, international travel, and continuous learning.
                <i>I perpetually seek new horizons.</i>
