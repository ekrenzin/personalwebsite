            My journey began in New York City's graphic design scene, where I quickly found a passion
            for creativity. However, I aimed higher—I wanted to build the tools I used, leading me to
            transition into software engineering.
            <i>Innovation became my driving force.</i>
            <br /><br />
            Committed to mastering coding skills in my spare time, I soon advanced to an iOS developer
            role within the same company. My design roots continue to enrich my software solutions, blending
            aesthetics with functionality.
            <br /><br />
            Now, I specialize in emerging technologies like virtual reality. The hands-on experience of
            shaping this technology is a constant source of excitement.
            <i>It's as if I've finally found the missing piece.</i>
            <br /><br />
            Nearly a decade in, spanning various platforms and languages, my initial doubts have given
            way to confidence.
            <br /><br />
            I live in scenic California with my fiancé and our pets. My life outside of work includes daily
            runs on California's trails, global travel, and a commitment to continuous learning.
            <i>I'm always looking for the next challenge.</i>
