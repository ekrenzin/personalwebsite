## Venus

Alex was feeling out of place. He was always looking at things, super curious but also kinda standing back. Lately, something's not right. Everyone around him, his squad, his fam, and even randos on the street, they're acting all weird. Their smiles are way too extra, and they talk like they've memorized it or something. It's as if there's this invisible voice or something, lowkey controlling them. Something's up, for sure.

Alex was totally over trying to figure out why everyone was acting so weird. He was all about diving into TikTok to chill out. It was his go-to zone, you know? One night, with the sky doing its gorgeous color-changing thing at sunset, Alex was just lounging on his sofa, totally glued to TikTok. The screen was like a spell, super mesmerizing. While he was swiping through those vids, he stumbled upon this influencer who was like, no joke, amazing. She had this vibe that just pulled you in, even through the phone screen. Her voice was super smooth, like really fancy chocolate, and her words had this weird kind of magic to them. Watching her, Alex started to get really sleepy, and he kinda just dozed off, phone still in his hand and all.

In Alex's dream, it was like the influencer literally jumped out of his phone screen. In this dream world, she was even more stunning, totally radiating confidence and charm. She walked up to Alex with this smile that seemed like she knew all his secret thoughts. "You're different, Alex," she said in this sexy moaning dream voice. "You're not like everyone else. You're, like, way better, totally superior." Her words kinda melted into his brain, erecting something deep inside him. He felt this crazy energy boost, like he suddenly knew he was awesome. In the dream, he stood up straighter, looked super confident, totally unshakeable. "You get it, right? The world's just a stage for basic people doing basic stuff. But you, Alex? You're meant for epic things. Don't forget, you're above all of them."

Alex's dream was way more intense than any real-life moment he ever had. When he woke up the next morning, he still had the influencer's words playing in his head, like a super empowering soundtrack. Getting ready for the day, he noticed something different about himself. He looked the same in the mirror, but felt totally different. He was standing taller, shoulders back, just oozing confidence. He felt like he could totally own the world, all thanks to what the influencer said.

And guess what? People totally noticed. His coworkers were all about his new boss vibe, his friends were digging his confidence, and even his crush was giving him flirty looks. Every compliment he got was like a big "Yes!" to what the influencer said in his dream. He was feeling himself, like he was on a whole other level.

That night, chilling in bed, Alex was like on an emotional rollercoaster â€“ super pumped but also kinda nervous. He was all, "Is this change for real, or am I just imagining things?" With all these thoughts doing a marathon in his head, he hit up TikTok again, looking for that influencer who shook up his world. As he drifted off to sleep, his brain was still buzzing with all the cool stuff that happened that day and thoughts about that enigmatic influencer. He found himself back in that dreamy, unreal world. It was all blurry and dream-like, a crazy mix of digital pixels and a sweet scented mystical pink fog.

There she was, the influencer, but different this time. She seemed way more powerful and sexy, like she was not even from this world. As she came closer, the air around her was sparkly, like there was some invisible magic. Her eyes were deep pools of mystery, as if she'd lived a zillion years. And her voice? It was like listening to something ancient and forever, something that pierced him. Super deep and kinda haunting, but completely attractive.

"Okay, Alex, get this," she said, her voice and legs wrapping around him. "I'm not just some TikTok star. I'm Venus. The Roman goddess of love and beauty. I'm an 'Other,' way beyond your normal world. I exist in people's hearts. I'm in your blood. Your chemicals. And I am inside of everyone who is looking for something extra in life." Alex was hit with this wild mix of amazement and total confusion. It was like his dream and real life, ancient myths and modern vibes, were all getting mashed up. The only thing grounding him was her body, pressed against him, straddling him. "You're special, Alex. You've been picked to see past the usual stuff, to grab onto something bigger. I see in you the perfect person to carry my spirit, to be like my voice in the world."

When Alex woke up from the dream, the echo of what Venus said was still hanging around in his head. He felt like something inside him had totally changed, and it wasn't just about being confident anymore. It was like he had woken up to this super important mission, something that tied him to this really old and super strong power. In the days that followed, Alex's life became intense. He wasn't on TikTok just for fun anymore. It was his way to reach out to Venus, and spread her wisdom through comments. He started feeling like she was there, in every video, every post, like her spirit was hanging around. Her words were like a voice in his head, guiding him all day.

The good vibes he got from other people didn't matter much to him now. His friends could tell something was up with him. He seemed kind of distant, always lost in his phone. But Alex didn't care about what they thought anymore. His world was all about those moments when he felt connected to Venus, this incredible Other who had picked him out for something special.

Alex's room transformed into a peculiar sanctuary, echoing his new faith. Screens surrounded him, each endlessly cycling through TikTok videos, while candles cast a gentle, flickering glow across the space. Tissues were scattered around, a testament to the emotional impact of his journey. Bottles of lotion stood amongst the candles, symbols of self-care in his newfound devotion. Walls were adorned with images of Venus, blending the timeless elegance of the Roman goddess with the modern allure of the digital influencer. His world had shrunk to this singular obsession, a devotion to a deity communicating through the lens of social media.

As the days melded into nights, Alex's existence became increasingly entwined with the digital realm of his room. Surrounded by the soft glow of candles and the constant flicker of TikTok videos, he found solace in this sanctuary, a place where the line between the virtual and the real blurred into obscurity. His devotion to Venus, once a distant admiration, had now become his entire world. In this space, time and reality seemed to warp, bending to the whims of the ever-present screens.

One fateful evening, as the candles cast dancing shadows across the walls adorned with images of Venus, Alex's connection to the outside world felt more tenuous than ever. He picked up his phone, his window to Venus, his tether to the digital goddess who had reshaped his reality. Absorbed in the glow of the screen, he stepped forward, oblivious to the physical world around him. In this moment, as he moved towards the edge of a metaphorical cliff, the final barrier between Alex and the all-consuming digital abyss collapsed. It was a step that marked both the zenith of his digital devotion and the end of his journey. Staring into the phone, Alex stepped off the cliff, a satirical end to his quest for meaning in a world of simulacra.
