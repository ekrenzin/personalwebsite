Let’s talk structure, he said to me. Dread. I glance up at him, towering above castle-like in his stone tartan suit. When you write, you need structure. You need to follow the conventions or nobody will understand your writing and they will struggle to get through the sentence and it will drone on so that they simply skip over it and read the next one. His words fly past me. Seven words is the number you’ve got. The optimal number of words in sentences. Check your sentences – count how many words. I go back and check my work. Well, the last few sentences were exactly seven words. Count again. I count seven but say nine. “And lack of punctuation? Come on. How can anyone tell what you are writing about?” he says. “When does the dialogue begin and end?” he says. “Ok.” I reply.

“And each time you change speaker, make that clear, just add a new line.” He says to me.

“Yes sir.” I reply

“Why don’t the character have names?” He asks.

“Do the names matter?” I ask. He scoffs and turns away. “Sorry, the characters are uh… Gray and White.”

“Mr. Gray and Ms. White, like our names? A suppose it’s better than he and I,” says Mr. Gray, with a visible grimace at my lack of creativity. 

I’m one of those children in a movie who sees a can of peas and a lemon and says the name is Cyprus and Penelope, combining citrus with the pea and the shoving the lemon in between two peas. Except I’m not that creative so I come up with Gray and White, our own fucking names. I’m such an idiot. Shit. “Your profanity is aggressive, urban and raw.” A compliment that I know is a mirage in this desert. “However, beyond the lack of creative characters, garbage structure, that you are a woman writing about a man and drugs, the largest issue is that I can tell you wrote this without knowing the ending. Frankly, the whole thing is crap.” There it is, and I know what comes next. “Gray Area Publishing will not be able to work with you. I appreciate your… efforts, but please take them elsewhere. Have a nice rest of your day.” He waves a hand in the air, shooing me away like a pesky fly.

It's not the rejection that hurts, it’s the way they look at you when they do it. They are Gauguin and all of those French bastards who go around and paint their perspective of us. They paint as a form of escapism which the rest of the bastards lap up, but then when Sargent comes around, and paints one of them, with a slipped strap and a suggestive glance, he has to repaint the damn thing. I let out a heavy exhale, one that empties my lungs. I hold my breath. I wait for those beautiful stars that come from killing off brain cells.

I think about how I could respond and tell Mr. Gray I had known the ending from the start. That it was a metaphor for creativity and the frustration of constraint and that the ending would naturally be suicide. It’s only logical. Addled artist grapples with their sense of identity, self, and meaning. Their abusive childhood that scarred them until they found an outlet in graffiti which lands them in the urban scene, sex, drugs, and close encounters with death. All of that tension building up until they leap in front of a train and die doing what they love. It was fucking beautiful. Or maybe it’s cliché. But when I look up at him, I’m Miss White and he’s Mr. Gray, and he controls the printing of ink on sheets of paper. And I’m afraid of the power that represents. “Thank you for your time, Mr. Gray, I sincerely appreciate your wisdom and expertise.” Mr. Gray grunts an approving grunt. He does not glance up from the manuscript he is now reading, his eyes straight down, gaze cresting the bridge of his nose and through the reading glasses. I mourn the next fallen soldier whose number will increment mine.


I press my body against the heavy glass door and exit the publishing building; So-Ho. There used to be a lot of print shops in this area, but times change. 

The sidewalk is stained with bubblegum, black polka dots. Like cancer, the dots are everywhere. My teeth ache a bit looking at them. If I scraped it off the ground, maybe it would still taste sweet. I’m fucking gross. But that’s what you see when you look down all the time. You see the gum, the trash, and the cracks. I don’t always look down, but when I walk down the street, I look down, and when someone looks at me, I look down. But I don’t always look down.

A flyer is thrust into my view. He’s wearing a red and white striped shirt. The vertical lines draw my gaze up. A black man smiles at me. His teeth glow. “Fuck you.” Are hot.

“Woah, ok never mind. I suppose you also hate starving children?” He retorts, his bright beautiful smile replaced by scorn. I want that smile back.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean it. Uh, rough day.” His collar bone tugs at his shirt so suggestively, like it’s daring me to pull it down, and look. “For the record, I do care about uh…” I look down at the flyer. “Starving children in Indonesia.” I absentmindedly tuck my hair neatly behind my ear. I glance up and his gorgeous smile is back. But he’s not in front of me anymore. He’s speaking with an older man now, emphatically, passionately. Shit. I keep walking.

My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse stops vibrating. I pull out my phone. Missed call from Mom. I put it back and keep walking.

I’m at Christopher street now. The path station. I don’t really remember getting here, but that’s how it always is. One foot in front of the other in front of the other until you are in the subway waiting for your train. Your mind glosses over the repetition in walking. I rest against a tiled pillar. The experience is tribal in a way, like a caveman. We even have cave paintings. I look at one of the hieroglyphics on the pillar across from me. “Sleep is the answer.” It’s a graphic of a mattress and a smiling stick figure face. I bet the stick figure is smiling because she sleeps 8 hours a day. Only stick figures can sleep that much. I pull out my phone and scroll.

The station trembles when a train arrives. It’s like the station is aroused, waiting for the train to penetrate her with such vigor that her walls shake. When it finally comes to a stop, and the doors open, the people are sperm. Off to impregnate the next station. 

I put my phone away and step into the train. It’s mid-day and rather empty. I sit in a bright orange seat with no neighbors. The announcer chimes in: “Next stop Jersey City.” I look around at the other passengers. A man is sprawled across several seats. He has worn down shoes, which look like they are about to fall off. I’m reminded of a baby sloth clinging to her mother. On the left shoe, there is a large hole right on the big toe. A long yellowed nail protrudes from the opening. I look away.

The middle doors crash open and a group of men carrying a boombox steps into our car. I notice their skin color first. Shit. They spread out through the car. One man flips his cap off his durag and waves it like a bone in front of each of us, skipping the sprawled-out man. I can’t tell if they even see him. One of the other passengers plucks a twenty from her purse. I watch as the money drops into the mans cap. He smiles and thanks her, and I think of the flyer again. Shit. I rummage through my purse looking for something to give. The pan is waved expectantly in front of me. Two jerks of the cap, signaling me to hurry the fuck up. I don’t have a twenty. I find a few coins, and just as I am about to drop them into the mans cap, he pulls it away. “Damn, you cheap as fuck.” I look up at him to retort, but he’s off smiling in front of an older gentleman. The fee is paid, and the music begins. My thighs suddenly itch, and I scratch. 

The men begin their routine. They jump on the seats, and swing from the metal beams. One of the men lays on the ground and begins to twirl. His black jeans contrast his white shirt and as he spins I am hypnotized. The alternating oranges, reds, and yellows of the seats swirl as the train curves under the river. Another does pullups, and a thirds continues to jump around. It’s a circus. Suddenly I see them as monkeys. Shit. I whip the thought from my mind. Shit.

The song ends and they press the button at the other side of the train car to exit. They exit in a line so uniformly, and I realize the entire act was part of their performance. Shit.

The man is still sprawled out, with his proud yellowed toenail. I pull out my phone and swipe to Word. I read from my new book.

I push on the needle down and the words flow like pictures and I’m floating and I’m high and it doesn’t matter that the sky is gray with storm clouds because those clouds are fumes of paint. And paint is my blood.

I wake up. And feel down. Fuck. I scratch my cheek, sliding fingers through beard. My fur brown and blonde and ginger. I slide my hand down into my pants and scratch there too, and my leg twitches like a dog. And I shout out. I roll over and rub my eyes, my hands still sticky from sleep. My eyes still sticky from sleep. I look up, and around. I’m on a bench. I don’t remember getting here, although I sort of do. I was with someone, I think we had sex. My hand is sticky like we had sex, but I could have been by myself. I realize that answers nothing. I don’t know how I got here. But I remember my mom. Maybe that’s how I ended up here. I remember the flames tears rage anger violence spit blood sweat cops chains shackles, I remember that cell. The bars so straight. F. That’s what they called me in there. Maybe it was the name which got me here. I don’t know.

I scratch at my foot, calloused and yellow from walking in the streets at night. One of my shoes is still on, the left one. It’s the good shoe, but they both have holes around the big toe. That’s where my toenail scratches when I’m high. When the electricity shoots through my veins and I tense up and my feet wriggle like the fish in Gollum’s mouth, I am the Ring and Gollum consumes me. I read that book as a kid. I read that book last year.

Yeah. It’s crap. I sigh, the metaphors are superficial and obvious. It’s crude for the sake of being provocative, and lacks depth. I don’t relate to the character. I don’t know why I’m writing about drugs when I’ve never done them. Ugh.

“Now arriving Grove Street. Next stop Journal Square.” Our train rattles to a stop in the station and the doors open like an air lock on a spaceship. I stand up, and look behind me, double checking that I hadn’t forgotten anything on the seat, then step out of the train. The hot air of the path station crashes into me. I shiver from the change.

An asian Monk in orange robes shakes jade beads at me. He chants something at me but I duck under his voice and scurry past. Clenching my teeth in a tight smile I look down to avoid confronting his eyes. As I rush to the stairs, I glance back to see the monk has pulled a cellphone from his robes and is scrolling. The overhead fans drown out my laugh as I exit the path station back to the sidewalk. Foot in front of foot in front of foot until I’m back to my apartment.

It takes my whole body to pry open the heavy wood. I’m like Sisyphus, and the door slams behind me as I trip inside. 500 feet, apparently square, my apartment is small, but also big. It’s big. Or small. I think it’s small. I throw my keys on the counter, hang my purse, and walk across the room. It’s two rooms, one with a bed, the other everything else. I walk over to the computer where I sit down. I begin to type.

Colors constrain my mind and when
I re-count the day I count the colors
Black, Red, Orange, Yellow,
White, black. Gray. So fucking gray. Fucking Gray. I hate gray. Everything is gray and I hate it. When they take photos, the background is gray. My memories are gray. I pretend there are colors, I write as if there are colors, but it’s all gray. The words I type mix black with white and are gray. Gray gray gray gray fucking Mr. Gray. Mr. Gray’s office was gray, his suit was gray, the publishing building was gray, the sidewalk was gray, the path station was gray, the train was gray, the man's sock was gray, my apartment walls are gray.

I can’t tell if I typed it right, but it’s out there now, and I feel better. I hold backspace till I see white and feel worse. I hate myself. I try again.

I shut my doors, threw the key out to sea.
I decree to all: I refuse to see!
Yet still they come in flocks, like birds, to me,
expecting eyes and ears complete and free.

Now peace, that which I have so tantalized,
Finally a moment, I fantasized,
breath of air! The quiet of just me! To
wake from soft morning breeze across the dew.

open windows to the night; to the coo
Of doves, generations, not of few,
Ah their kisses, and love, how sweet they hum,
Before: “BOOM” a knock at the door, a drum.

“Just a lone moment please. Sign here in pen
good sir, I will leave you forever then.”
“One moment? Strange indeed for you inquire,
One moment is that I too do desire.”

I open to see them in full and stark,
the sight is of a talking bird: a stork!
How mighty is this bird whose massive beak
carries within gentle babe wrapped in sheet.

I gasp in awe, at the sight from his maw
a shock to my system I cannot draw
air and the thought of this new mouth to feed
Whence I had so very nearly been freed.

I cry and decree: "T'is a lie good stork
This cannot be true, I am not of sport,
My shots are not straight, completely askew,
Why must you come to establish a zoo?"

"Well good sir, at least one of your targets
was struck by cupids arrow, and carpets
have been laid down the aisle
Avoid as you may, this may take a while."

It doesn’t flow. My wrist itches and I scratch. “Carpets” The letter “R” is such an awful letter. It makes everything sound hard. I think of words with an R. Shit. I hear a noise from  across the room. It’s my purse rattling the coat hanger. I push my chair back from the desk and spin. I walk over to it. It’s my mom. I let it ring. I let it ring. I feel guilt. I let it ring. Missed call from mom. My phone vibrates again. Text from mom. “Please Call me back ita urgent. I love you” Shit. 

I tap the missed call notification and it starts to ring. She picks up before it rings a second time. Shit. “Hey Honey, thanks for calling me back, I missed you.” 

“You said it was urgent?”

“Is it not urgent for a mom to miss her child?” She pauses for a moment, expecting a laugh. She clears her throat. “Ehem, we’ll actually I have some bad news.” She pauses again, and when she resumes I can hear her voice wavering a bit. “I uh.”
I cut her off. “You need more money? I don’t have much right now. Look, times are really tough right now.”
“Oh, uh, yes sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.” Her voice sounds confident, and I realize maybe she wasn’t calling about money. Shit.

“How are things Mom?” I toss a lifesaver.

“I’m dying.” My vision goes black. No fucking foreplay. One word after the next word after the next word and suddenly I’ve agreed to meet. Shit.
