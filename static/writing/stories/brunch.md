## Brunch


I enter the brunch shop. I am with my fiancé, for our weekly treat. Today we want to sit inside. This is atypical. Usually we sit outside, under the red umbrellas that filter light and tint the experience. But today it is hot. Not the typical hot of summer, but the atypical kind. That of somewhere very hot. Or perhaps it’s simply typical for it to be atypically hot. In either case, today we want to sit inside. So when the waitress greets us and guides us to our seat, it’s a pleasant air-conditioned seat. And when we sit down, the seat has a cushion, and a back. A truly pleasant back on the seat, padded and wrapped in a light brown faux leather. The waitress asks what we will be drinking. A coffee for me. Just water today for my fiancé. I glance at my menu, although I am already certain of what I will be ordering: a breakfast burrito with sausage. The fiancé wanders more. She looks over the menu. Evaluating her options. Neither of us is hungry. We question why we went to brunch when we are not hungry. The answer is in the hot coffee now arriving. In the pages of the book resting on the table. We remember why we went to brunch. So we order a burrito to share. A breakfast burrito with sausage. A conversation sparks up. We discuss people and meaning. I say something about what I am reading. She says something about what I am reading. The burrito arrives, cut in two, divided equally onto two plates. She has the larger half. I pluck her half of the burrito from her plate, and swap it with my own – theft for the hungrier. The waitress brings Cholula sauce and departs once more.  We discuss her class, and ideas. I present an opinion. The coffee empties and is refilled. She tells me about another idea. I have no opinion. I finish my half of the burrito, and she finishes a quarter of the burrito. Unable to eat more, she plucks half of her half of the burrito and plops the remains onto my plate. I notice an orange slice on the plate now. I had been transfixed by the burrito, but now the orange slice is the original resident of the plate, and the burrito is the invader. Yet the burrito was originally sawed in half, and plucked from this plate to be replaced by a larger half. And before that it was a whole burrito plucked and plopped onto two plates. I get lost in what defines a burrito, and open my book. She tells me more about her school, but I’m reading now and my answers are non-committal. The world flows away, and the ink blots out my visions until I swim in the ponderings of thinkers past. More coffee? Please, and thank you. And the coffee is refilled and I continue reading. I consider an assignment. To replicate the style of authors. This interests her. I suggest a few names. These do not interest her. She suggests a few names. These do not interest me. She says I should include a woman. I ask why. She says it would be interesting. I ask why. She says the contrast. I agree because it does make sense. I look down at the pages. Written by a man. I consider the style of men. How we replicate that style, learn from it, and shape our thoughts. The words we think are of men. And it troubles me. I keep the comment to myself. She tells me about sex positivity and argues that women slut shame more than men. It seems nonsensical, but perhaps. I ask her to elaborate because there are so many examples of men suppressing women. This country is not sex-positive. I ask relative to what. Europe. I find it interesting and wander a bit with her. I tease out the truth in that. That turtle hides deep within a shell, so I leave it be. Often the head only pokes out when it is unchallenged. I drain my coffee. Reject a refill, cram the final bite of the burrito into my mouth, and we depart.
