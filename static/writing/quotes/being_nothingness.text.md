> Anguish is therefore freedom’s reflective self-apprehension: in this sense it is a mediation, because—although it is immediately conscious of itself—it arises out of the negation of the calls made upon me by the world; it appears as soon as I disengage from the world in which I was committed, to apprehend myself as a consciousness with a preontological understanding of its essence,

> They belong to the objective situation in the manner of a transcendent structure, or—put differently, and in Heideggerean terminology—I myself will write this book but “they” may also not write it. 53 By these means I may hide from myself that these possibles are myself and immanent conditions of my possible’s possibility.

> It is a matter of imagining my Self as a small God inhabiting me and possessing my freedom as a metaphysical property.

> Thus we flee from anguish by trying to grasp ourselves from outside as an Other or as a thing.

---

### Note on Page The (Location of)
> But if I am the thing I want to mask, the question takes on an entirely different dimension: I cannot in effect will “not to see” some particular aspect of my being if I am fully aware of exactly the aspect that I want not to see. In other words, I am obliged to indicate it in my being, in order to be capable of turning away from it; better still, I am obliged constantly to think about it, in order to make sure I am not thinking about it. We must take this to mean not only that I must—necessarily—constantly carry along with me what I wish to flee from but also that I have to aim at the object I am fleeing from in order to flee it; in other words, my anguish, my intentional aiming at anguish, and my flight from anguish toward reassuring myths must be given within the unity of a single consciousness.

### Note on Page The (Location of)
> flight from anguish is just one way of becoming conscious of anguish.

> The meaning of this look is not, and that is what bothers me. Whatever I do—smile, promise, threaten—nothing can win me the approval, the free judgment I am seeking. Part Two: Being-For-Itself

### Note on Page Self-Presence (Location Page)
> It is only at the reflective level that an ἐποχή—a bracketing—can be attempted, and that we can refuse to “mitmachen,” as Husserl put it.

---

### Note on Page Self-Presence (Location Page)
> This self-presence has often been understood as a plenitude of existence, and a widely held prejudice among philosophers attributes to consciousness the highest dignity of being.

---

### Note on Page The (Location Facticity)
> I think therefore I am. What am I? A being who is not his own foundation, and who, insofar as he is a being, might be other than he is, to the extent to which he does not explain his being.

---

### Note on Page The (Location Facticity)
> If indeed being, as the nihilation of its own being, is the foundation of nothingness, that does not amount to saying it is the foundation of its being.

---

### Note on Page The (Location Facticity)
> The act of causation through which God is causa sui is—like any reclamation by something of itself—a nihilating act, to the precise extent to which the most basic relation is necessarily a return to itself, a reflexivity.

---

### Note on Page The (Location Facticity)
> possibility may indeed be given to us before being, but it is given to us, and it is not the possibility of this being;

---

### Note on Page The (Location Facticity)
> Strictly speaking, my facticity is not even the resistance of facts, since it is by taking it up within the infrastructure of my prereflective cogito that I endow it with its meaning and its resistance.

---

### Note on Page The (Location and)
> If human-reality were limited to the being of the I think, its only truth would be the truth of an instant.

---

### Note on Page The (Location and)
> We suffer, and we suffer through not suffering enough.

---

### Note on Page The (Location and)
> What we call the “greatest” or “best” or “true” suffering—a suffering that moves us—is the suffering we can read on others’ faces or, better still, on portraits, on a statue’s face, on a tragic mask. This suffering has being.

---

### Note on Page The (Location and)
> Every groan, every facial expression of the suffering person, aims to sculpt an in itself statue out of suffering. But this statue can exist only through others, and only for others. My suffering suffers from being what it is not,

> Thus the for-itself, as a non-thetic consciousness (of) self, does not exist confronting value, in the sense in which, for Leibniz, the monad exists “alone, before God.” 29

> The possibility of being stopped by a fold in the carpet belongs neither to the rolling marble nor to the carpet: it can arise only within a system in which the marble and the carpet are organized by a being who has an understanding of the possibles.

> My consciousness (of) reading is not a consciousness (of) reading this letter, or this word or sentence, or even this paragraph—but the consciousness (of) reading this book, which in turn refers me to all the pages that are not yet read, and all the pages that are already read, and which, by definition, separates consciousness from itself. A consciousness that was conscious only of what it is would be obliged to spell each word out.

### Note on Page Phenomenology (Location the)
> the past is no longer, the future is not yet and, with respect to the instantaneous present, everyone knows that it has no being at all, and lies at the limit of an infinite division, as a dimensionless point.

> “The terrible thing about Death,” says Malraux, “is that it transforms life into Destiny.”

---

### Note on Page Phenomenology (Location the)
> The attempt to go in the opposite direction—which is what Chevalier does—and which consists in presenting the greater urgency of the past as constituting life’s originality, is a completely meaningless ὕστερον πρότερον. 13

> That is what Sophocles means to express when, in The Trachiniae, he makes Deïanira say: “An old saying goes: ‘You can never know for sure whether a mortal’s life has been good or bad until his death.’ ”15 It is also the meaning of the sentence from Malraux that we quoted earlier: “Death changes life into destiny.’

### Note on Page Phenomenology (Location the)
> The past is substance. In this sense, Descartes’s cogito ought to be reformulated as: “I think, therefore I was.”

> There is a metaphysical problem about birth, to the extent that I can be concerned to know how I came to be born from that embryo—and perhaps that problem is insoluble.

---

### Note on Page Original (Location and)
> In brief, reflection is in bad faith insofar as it is constituted as disclosing the object that I myself am.

---

### Note on Page Original (Location and)
> Impure reflection is an abortive effort on the part of the for-itself to be another by remaining itself.

---

### Note on Page Original (Location and)
> an inert and in-itself object is constituted that our language finds it difficult to name, in which the in-itself and autonomous love is magically extended throughout the friendship, in the way in which, in the Stoic doctrine of σύγχυσις, the leg extends throughout the sea. 61

### Note on Page Original (Location and)
> the for-itself sees itself almost conferring an “outside” on itself, in its own eyes: but this “outside” is purely virtual.

---

### Note on Page Knowledge (Location a)
> The only kind of knowledge is intuitive. Deduction and discourse, which are incorrectly labeled as “knowledge,” are only instruments leading to intuition.

---

### Note on Page Knowledge (Location a)
> In this way each of the two nascent terms of the dyad points toward the other, and the being of each one is engaged within the other’s being. But if the reflecting is nothing but a reflecting of this reflection, and if the reflection can be characterized only by its “being-in-order-to be reflected in this reflecting,” the two terms of the quasi-dyad, bracing their two nothingnesses against each other, are jointly annihilated.

---

### Note on Page Knowledge (Location a)
> But if, on the other hand, the reflection was something—independently of its being-in-order-to-be-reflected—we would have to qualify it not as a reflection but as in-itself.

---

### Note on Page Knowledge (Location a)
> The reflection can only be “something to be reflected” and at the same time nothing if it becomes qualified by something other than itself or, alternatively, if it is reflected as a relation to an “outside” that it is not.

> qua negativity—“ not being beautiful” is a real quality of myself, and this negative quality explains my melancholy, for example, just as effectively as my lack of worldly success.

> Every attempt made by the donkey to catch the carrot has the effect of moving the harnessed cart forward in its entirety—along with the carrot itself, which remains always at the same distance from the donkey. In this way, we run after a possible that is brought into view precisely by our running—a possible that is nothing other than our running, and which by that very fact is determined as being out of reach.

### Note on Page The (Location of)
> God is, and at the same time is not, myself and the Other, since he creates us. Indeed, it is fitting that he should be myself, in order to apprehend my reality without intermediary and in apodictic evidence, and that he should not be me, in order to retain his impartiality as a witness, and to be able to be, and to not be, over there, the Other.

---

### Note on Page Husserl, (Location Heidegger)
> Does that mean that the concept of the Other is a priori?

---

### Note on Page Husserl, (Location Heidegger)
> I once believed that I could escape solipsism by denying Husserl the existence of his transcendental “Ego.”

---

### Note on Page Husserl, (Location Heidegger)
> The equivalence of “Ego = Ego” or “I = I” is just what expresses this fact. In the first place, this self-consciousness is a pure identity with itself, pure existence for itself. It has certainty of itself, but this certainty still lacks truth.

---

### Note on Page 2: (Location Body)
> I am the other in relation to my eye: I apprehend it as a sensory organ constituted in such and such a way within the world, but I cannot “see it seeing,” which is to say I cannot apprehend it insofar as it reveals an aspect of the world to me.

---

> Maine de Biran’s famous “sensation of effort” does not really exist.

> The illumination of the screen belonged to my world; my eyes, as objective organs, belonged to the experimenter’s world.

### Note on Page The (Location as)
> The Müller-Lyer illusion, the relativity of the senses, etc., are so many names given to objective laws concerning the structures of these figures. These laws do not inform us about appearances but concern synthetic structures.

---

### Note on Page The (Location as)
> My reflective consciousness will indeed give me knowledge of my reflective consciousness of the inkpot, but not knowledge of a sensory activity. It is in this sense that we should take Auguste Comte’s famous claim: “The eye cannot see itself.”

---

### Note on Page The (Location as)
> Thus the structure of the world implies that we cannot see without being visible.

---

### Note on Page The (Location as)
> In this way, sight does not produce visual sensations, and nor is it affected by light rays; rather, it is the collection of all visible objects insofar as their objective and reciprocal relations all refer to specific magnitudes that are chosen—and undergone at the same time—as measures, and to a specific center of perspective.

> is evident, in the first place, that consciousness can exist its body only as consciousness. In this way, my body is a conscious structure of my consciousness.

### Note on Page The (Location as)
> Who abstracts? If, according to M. Laporte’s definition, to abstract something is to think separately structures that are unable to exist separated, we are obliged either to identify abstract emotions with pure abstract concepts of emotions, or to acknowledge that these abstractions are unable to exist as such, as real modalities of consciousness.

---

### Note on Page The (Location as)
> Let us first take note that, however absorbed I may be by my reading, I do not thereby cease to bring the world to being; better still, my reading is an act that implies in its very nature the existence of the world as a necessary ground.

> This medium is not grasped for itself, except in the way that a statue’s matter is grasped when I perceive its form, and yet it is there: it is the passivity on which the ache gnaws and which magically gives it new strength, as the earth did to Antaeus.

### Note on Page The (Location >)
> In short, to use an expression that is inapt but familiar, I know the Other through my senses. 16 Just as the Other is the instrument of which I make use, by means of the instrument that I am, so too is he the system of sensory organs that is revealed to my sensory knowledge; in other words, he is a facticity appearing to a facticity.

> But now Pierre appears; he comes into my bedroom. This appearing changes nothing in the fundamental structure of my relation to him: it is contingent, but his absence was contingent.

---

> Consciousness does not know its character—unless it determines it reflectively, on the basis of the Other’s point of view; it exists it in a pure lack of distinction, non-thematically and non-thetically, in its experience of its own contingency, and in the nihilation through which it recognizes and surpasses its facticity. That is why a pure introspective description of oneself does not deliver any character:

### Note on Page The (Location Ontological)
> With the appearance of the Other’s look, I have the revelation of my object-being, which is to say of my transcendence as transcended.

---

### Note on Page The (Location Ontological)
> Thus I am constantly obliged to act “blindly,” to guess where to shoot, without ever knowing the results of my shot. That is why the timid person, after he has recognized the futility of these attempts, will endeavor to eliminate his body-for-the-other. When he wishes “not to have a body anymore,” or to be “invisible,” etc., it is not his body-for-himself that he wants to annihilate but this elusive dimension of the alienated-body.

---

### Note on Page Our (Location Attitude)
> My worry arises from the fact that I necessarily and freely accept this being that an Other, in absolute freedom, makes me be: “God knows what I am for her! God knows how she thinks of me.” That means: “God knows how she makes me be,”

---

### Note on Page Our (Location Attitude)
> I am haunted by this being, whom I am afraid of meeting one day at a bend in the road, who is such a stranger to me and who is nonetheless my being, and about whom I also know that, in spite of my efforts, I will never meet him. But if the Other loves me, I become unsurpassable, which means that I must be the absolute end; in this sense I am saved from equipmentality; my existence in the midst of the world becomes exactly correlative to my transcendence-for-myself, since my independence is absolutely protected.

> Man makes himself man in order to be God, we may say: and, considered from this point of view, ipseity might seem to be a kind of egoism; but precisely because there is no common measure between human-reality and the cause of itself that it wants to be, we might just as well say that man loses himself in order for the self-caused to exist.

### Note on Page 811 (Location Location)
> Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) was one of the great philosophers of the twentieth century and a renowned novelist, dramatist, and political activist. As a teenager, Sartre was drawn to philosophy after reading Henri Bergson’s Time and Free Will. He passed the agrégation in philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1929. His first novel, La Nausée, which Sartre considered one of his best works, was published in 1938. Sartre served as a meteorologist in the French army before being captured by German troops in 1940 and spending nine months as a prisoner of war. He continued to write during his captivity and, after his release, published his great trilogy of novels, Les Chemins de la Liberté. In 1964, Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but declined it. During the uprisings of 1968, he was arrested for civil disobedience but was swiftly released by President Charles de Gaulle, who allegedly said, “One does not arrest Voltaire.” Sartre died on April 15, 1980, in Paris, and his funeral attracted an enormous crowd of more than fifty thousand mourners. He is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. Index

> TN: Cet objet… appréhendé à travers la douleur, c’est le mal. In French the expression avoir mal is used to mean “to have a pain (or ache),” or in instances where in English we would say something hurts. On its own, le mal also means “evil,” and possibly Sartre intends a pun here. As Sartre is describing the creation of a psychological object, it seems important to translate le mal as a noun, and obviously it needs to be some noun other than “pain” (which I use, contrastively, to translate douleur). “Ache” seems to be the term that works best.
