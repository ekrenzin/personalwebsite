## Moving Past the Sword: The Pen of Modern Heroism

> The etymology of the word Hero derives from the Greek word ἥρως (hērōs), meaning protector or defender. The antithesis ειλός (deilós), encapsulates the attributes of cowardice or timidity, a stark departure from the valor typically associated with a hero.   
 
The endeavor to capture the essence of words, considering them not merely as symbols but as metaphors fraught with Foucauldian power, proves to be an intricate task. Words charged with the essence of pour-soi (Sartre’s for-itself) seldom align in a Platonic ideal, as contrasted to words of en-soi, which denote the manifested and physical. Indeed, heroism lives within the subjective, but by virtue of this, heroism exists phenomenologically within the everyday. Acts of heroism are predominantly linked to extraordinary valor, exemplified by figures like Hercules, Odysseus, or Achilles. However, upon candid introspection, one realizes these figures ostensibly embody heroism only in a relative context, even within the pages of their own story. While many would deem Odysseus’s actions heroic, Polyphemus and Poseidon would assuredly regard him as quite the devil. And the brilliance of the Trojan horse could only be described as devious by those defending Troy. Further, these “heroes” are not historical figures but rather conjured by the wonderful imagination of Homer, inspired by the tales before. Yet, to a young child, these forms of the pour-soi may shine as solitary beacons in an otherwise bleak world. Stories to latch upon, to wish upon. However, with that in mind, one is compelled to consider whether Odysseus or Homer is the hero; that those who wield the pen may exert a more protective influence on our lives than those who brandish the sword. In the modern world, wars of heroics are not waged against enemy nations but instead against systems of oppression. As such, the heroes of modern times are those who strive for peace and education rather than conquest or bloodshed.

Malala Yousafzai, now a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, began her journey as an everyday schoolgirl but rose to be a voice for education against the explosive oppression of the Taliban. Malala is the epitome of courage in the modern world, and yet her bravery is to expose her own vulnerability. She writes of her fear, sadness, and hope, “Since today was the last day of our school, we decided to play in the playground a bit longer. I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again.”  In her expressed vision for reopening her school, Malala engages in a quiet act of heroism that defies the oppressive narrative imposed by her adversaries. Her belief catalyzes psychological resistance, challenging the narrative of inevitable subjugation and fertilizing the ground for future acts of defiance. Ironically, through her initial optimism, Malala establishes her blog as a symbol of fortitude, regardless of its painful content. Her optimism does not invalidate her experience; rather, it subverts the tyranny's goal of eradicating hope and agency. Malala embodies the essence of heroism and defies ειλός (deilós), she made herself a target and in a chilling recount, describes the violence that this spurred: “In October 2012, on my way home from school, a masked gunman boarded my school bus and asked, ‘Who is Malala?’ He shot me on the left side of my head.”  This act of brutal retaliation against Malala's advocacy, paradoxically, magnifies her heroism; her willingness to confront such dire risks underscores not just defiance but a form of sacrificial valor, demolishing any trace of ειλός (deilós) that could be ascribed to her. Thus, in her paradoxical embrace of vulnerability and steadfast resolve, Malala disrupts the archetypal motifs surrounding heroism, reframing it within intellectual resistance and emotional authenticity. She validates that heroes need not be invulnerable warriors of lore; they can also be ordinary individuals who, in the face of abject adversity, choose not only to survive but to ideologically thrive.

In contrast to modern heroes like Malala, the heroism exhibited by Odysseus in Homer's "Odyssey" stems largely from physical prowess and strategic ingenuity. The heroism of Odysseus is most vividly demonstrated in feats such as the blinding of the Cyclops Polyphemus, cunningly executed with a wooden stake, and the slaughter of Penelope's suitors, achieved through martial skill and reclaiming his home. Here, the hero's currency is, unequivocally, his capacity for overcoming formidable obstacles through physical and strategic mastery. Yet, such actions take place within a cultural paradigm that valorizes domination and conquest, attributes frequently cloaked in the grandeur of the divine or predestined. Unlike Malala, whose heroism transgresses systemic norms without the backing of divine entities or predestined favor, Odysseus operates within a cultural framework where heroism is often a measure of one's alignment with the gods or destiny. His heroism, therefore, is externalized and often reactive, engendered by the circumstances he finds himself in—a stark departure from Malala's, which is fundamentally proactive, internal, and ideological. Where Odysseus's heroism is one of cunning and combat, Malala's is one of conviction and courage; where he is triumphant, hers is transformative. 

One finds an interesting parallel between Homer, the ancient poet, and Malala, the modern advocate. As the bardic architect of Odysseus' heroism, Homer effectively engages in a subtler form of heroism, molding mythos and ethos into collective consciousness. This influence transcends temporal and geographical boundaries, fortifying individual resolve through archetypal narratives. Thus, Homer's heroism resides not in combating mythical creatures but in etching eternal tales of courage and valor that embolden countless souls across millennia. Just as Homer's tales offer a lantern in the darkness, Malala's advocacy illuminates the oppressive shadows, offering a beacon of hope and education. Unlike Odysseus, whose heroism is codified by the standards of a bygone era, Homer and Malala are heroes in the very act of shaping perception and nurturing resilience against systemic maladies. Their heroism is not bound by the perimeters of their physical world but resonates in the boundless realm of ideas and ideals. While Odysseus wields a spear and shield, Homer and Malala wield the metaphorical pen—a weapon that fights not against flesh and blood but against ignorance and despair. Where Odysseus' heroism could be considered ephemeral, vanquishing immediate dangers but leaving untouched the systemic conditions that birth them, the heroism of Homer and Malala transcends the immediate to alter the very paradigms that define heroism. It is transformative, for it shifts the events and narratives that frame them, giving it an ever-lasting imprint on human consciousness.
To complicate the point, the heroism of Malala emanates not from myth but from documented struggle against very real social and systemic forces. While Homer's narrative contributions lend themselves to the realm of parable and allegory, Malala's acts are captured in articles, interviews, and her own memoirs. Her heroism exists in the empirical sphere, making it both immediate and deeply resonant with modern exigencies. It is an enactment of valor in real-time, addressing tangible issues like education, gender equality, and freedom of thought. Thus, while Homer offers heroism through the veil of myth, often imbuing his characters with divine or quasi-divine traits, Malala's heroism stands unadorned, authenticated by real-world validation, not divine intervention or literary embellishment. Her words, not codified in epic verse but in journalistic prose and autobiographical accounts, do not require the interpretation often necessitated by myth but present themselves in stark relief against the backdrop of modern society's pressing issues. Thus, Malala's form of heroism amplifies its impact by being deeply entrenched in the realism of contemporary struggle, engaging directly with a world that can see, hear, and validate her experience. Her heroism, in essence, becomes an immediate call to action, not a tale to be pondered upon but a reality to be changed.

While Malala epitomizes modern heroism, it is imperative to recognize that not all virtuous acts ascend to the plateau of heroics. To mandate heroism as a criterion for human worth would be a gross miscalculation. The propensity for heroism is not uniformly distributed, nor should it be a barometer of one's humanity. Heroes like Malala are exceptional precisely because they transgress normative boundaries, acting in ways that most people cannot or will not. Their value lies not in overshadowing the multitude but in representing ideals that can inspire collective action. In championing education for women, Malala transcends her individuality, embodying an ideal that is expansive and inclusive. It would be antithetical to her cause to consider heroism a metric for human validation. Indeed, Malala would argue that the girls and women she aims to empower, while perhaps not 'heroic' in the conventional sense, possess intrinsic worth that heroism neither confers nor can take away. Thus, while her actions encapsulate the very essence of heroism, they also underscore the importance of recognizing and respecting the intrinsic human value independent of such grand gestures.
 


## Discussion #1:

> I was part of a discussion on the subject and opted to spark a bit of controversy with my analysis of heroism. Here is a continuation of my thoughts (notably more confrontational):

The heroism of Odysseus is exemplified in his cleverness and perseverance, most famously by his crafty plan to hide within a Trojan horse. Odysseus’s perseverance is shown through unwavering tenacity during his ten-year voyage back to Ithaca. Ironically, in the modern world, many of these traits find their contemporaries in hackers like Edward Snowden. Just as Odysseus navigated the ocean and encountered hordes of monsters, hackers chart the complex digital seas and expose uncomfortable truths. The most famous modern computer virus is literally named the 'Trojan horse.' It is a hacking technique that poses malware as innocent software. It's humorous to consider that the (portrayed) frail hackers in hoodies of today share more with the brawny ancient hero than first meets the eye — pun intended.

However, Snowden is perhaps better likened to Achilles, a figure immortalized in another of Homer's epics "Iliad," rather than Odysseus of “The Odyssey.” Like Achilles, Snowden emerged from a relatively obscure position to play a central role in a major conflict — Achilles in the Trojan War and Snowden in the debate over privacy and surveillance in the digital age. Both figures challenged the system: Achilles defied Agamemnon, the Greek leader, and Snowden challenged the U.S. government. Achilles was a hero defined not only by his skill in combat but by his individualism—a man who chose personal integrity over blind allegiance. Snowden's disclosures, driven by a strong personal conviction, mirror Achilles' choice to follow his principles, even when it led to direct conflict with the establishment. With that said, Achilles' quarrel with Agamemnon was personal, driven by pride and honor, while Snowden’s actions were ideologically driven, rooted in concerns over privacy and surveillance. Thus one might consider Snowden more heroic, as his motivation was selfless.

Notably, modern battles and wars are increasingly fought on the digital frontlines rather than physical battlefields. The weapons have evolved from spears and shields to data packets and encryption keys, yet the essence of combat remains unchanged: it is a test of wills, strategy, and resilience. In the realm of cyberspace, individuals like Snowden engage in conflicts that, while (usually) bloodless, carry significant societal implications.
Whistleblowing, much like the defiance of Achilles, may be perceived by some as betrayal, yet by others as courage. It is this dichotomy that exemplifies heroics: the hero is not without flaws or controversy but rather someone who drives conversation and change within society. Today's heroes are often ordinary individuals who choose to act extraordinarily. These modern heroes are particularly brilliant contrasted with the pre-destined extraordinary demigods acting as they were born to do. In this context, the contemporary hero is a symbol of the potential for greatness that lies within us instead of our destined greatness.
The concept of heroism, therefore, persists against Chronos. Thus, while heroism connects characters from antiquity to contemporary figures, it is not Platonic; heroism is born from the subjective, and thus, the ontology of the hero is ever-changing. What defines heroism is not merely the actions themselves but the values they represent and the societal reactions they provoke.

Now, with that said, when Odysseus tricks Polyphemus, one cannot help but be star-struck. Odysseus and his men find themselves trapped in the Cyclops's cave, with escape seemingly a fantasy. After intoxicating Polyphemus with wine, Odysseus introduces himself as "Nobody.” When the blinded cyclops screams in agony, calling for help from his fellow giants, he claims that "Nobody" is hurting him, so “Nobody” comes to help him. Ultimately, however, the act is heroic not because of Odysseus's intellect but rather because Odysseus saved the lives of his men. A modern example of saving the lives of others through skill and intellect is Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, the pilot who, in 2009, landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River after both engines failed post-takeoff. Sullenberger's quick thinking and skilled maneuvering saved the lives of all 155 passengers aboard. His actions resonate with the tale of Odysseus—navigating a dire situation with calm and calculated precision. Ironically one might metaphorically link the storm (and impressive captaining) sent with the wrath of Poseidon following the blinding of Polyphemus more closely with the disastrous situation that befell Sully, rather than the brutal act of blinding.

In conclusion, the essence of heroism is enduring, transcending the bounds of time from the age of myth to our digital epoch. The qualities exemplified by Odysseus—ingenuity under duress and the determination to safeguard his comrades—are not relics of the past but resonate through the ages, finding embodiment in modern figures like Snowden and Sullenberger. While the arenas of their deeds differ vastly, the core of what makes them heroic remains the same: the impact of their actions, driven by conviction and intellect, alters the course of events for the greater good. Heroism, as demonstrated, is not a Platonic form with a fixed ontology; it is a construct ever evolving, shaped by societal values and the exigencies of the times. Whether in the guise of a Greek mariner outwitting a Cyclops or a pilot deftly landing a plane on a river, heroes compel us to reflect on the virtues we cherish and the legacies we aspire to leave. Thus, societies seek heroes not merely for inspiration but as pillars to uphold the ideals we esteem throughout the winding odyssey of human experience.

Your analysis of bravery which links Edward Snowden and Odysseus to contemporary personalities, was quite interesting. It was an amazing twist to compare Snowden to Achilles, highlighting the ideological underpinnings underlying both acts.  you did a great job connecting Captain Sullenberger's landing of US Airways Flight 1549 to Odysseus's deceitful Polyphemus. It demonstrated how bravery fueled by intelligence and the will to defend others remains a timeless ideal. your theory that heroism changes according to cultural norms and the eras we live in is fascinating. It's a wonderful idea to consider that heroes don't just happen they are formed by society's reactions.

### Harman

I agree with the points you’ve made because they effectively highlight the enduring qualities of heroism and how they can be found in both ancient and modern contexts. The comparison between Odysseus and figures like Edward Snowden and Captain Sullenberger helps to bridge the gap between mythology and contemporary society, showing that heroism is not confined to the distant past. Also emphasizes that heroism is not a static concept, but rather one that evolves over time.

### Megan
The digital frontier as the battlefield of today is a nice idea. There is a lot of that going on. Unfortunately, we also have plenty of people dying in the real world, and I feel like not acknowledging that undervalues the men and women who fight for this country and other countries on the battlefields. If you want an example of Achilles today, what about what is going on in the Ukraine? What about that country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has managed to keep Russia at bay all this time, despite the fact that Russia is a much larger country? That is kind of heroic and definitely not on a computer. Real people are dying. 

This is not to undermine your comparison, just to make a side note that the battlefields of old have changed, but only with more modern killing instruments and people are still out there fighting them. 


## Discussion #2

Hello Darlene,

I agree with your perspective that heroic events exist on a diverse spectrum rather than within a fixed definition. Your analysis on Odysseus is fascinating due to your focus on a frequently overlooked dimension of his heroism — the return to Penelope. While not everyone would consider this relationship to be entirely heroic, considering the affairs on his journey, I agree with your perspective. In fact, Odysseus’s perseverance and will to return home is perhaps his greatest display of heroics, as his determination is perhaps his most human quality. That is to say, my subjective definition of heroics heralds commitment above extravagance. Furthermore, I vehemently reject the notions of heroics in destiny. In other words, following your destiny is not heroic, but instead dutiful.

Indeed, this train of thinking is what I found most compelling about Achilles. Immediately, Achilles makes it clear to the reader that he will not mindlessly follow Agamemnon. Rather than following leadership, Achilles upholds an individualism that elevates him to heroics. My argument, therefore, is that a hero chooses to be heroic.

It is my position that a person can only be heroic through a conscious acknowledgment of their own actions. They must be aware of their actions' consequences before they unfold. That is to say, to be heroic, one must understand the totality of the circumstances resulting from the propagation of their motion. This means that a person who slaughters the suitors of their wife is heroic only if they experience a sensation of consequence. Merciless slaughter is brutal to prop up in our contemporary society. To avoid a strawman argument on the morality of this, let’s quickly dissect why a sensation of consequence is essential.

Consider the scenario where Odysseus returns home and kills all of Penelope’s suitors out of principle. He simply sees them with his wife, and off goes their heads. In this scenario, Odysseus would not be heroic. He justified murder without the totality of the circumstances. In his time away, did Odysseus not sleep with other women? Should Penelope desire those women executed? Naturally, she might experience a range of emotions, but ultimately, Penelope should not operate reactively but rather patiently. Penelope will eventually realize without the aid of Calypso and Circe, there would be no Odysseus to return home.

Regarding Odysseus, his actions are heroic in relation to his eventual reunion. Upon returning to Ithaca in disguise, Odysseus gradually learns about the suitors occupying his palace (although he has already heard whispers through Athena and others). As Odysseus interacts with the suitors, their servants, and his family members while disguised as a beggar, he gains insight into their disrespectful and extravagant behavior, plans to marry Penelope, and their plot to kill his son, Telemachus. This allows Odysseus to assess the totality of the situation. His observations and interactions under disguise not only provide him with the necessary information to execute his plan but also enable him to make a conscious choice.

Thus, we see the heroics of Odysseus demonstrated through mercy. This may seem to be an obscure jump; however, consider that mercy does not necessitate lenience but rather the granting of an opportunity to demonstrate improved behavior. Mercy does not necessitate that the subject of one's power is aware of this opportunity, merely that the opportunity is given. This line of thought is undoubtedly contestable, but to borrow from religious scripture, one might consider Matthew 21:28-32, the Parable of the Two Sons. This parable is used to emphasize the importance of genuine repentance and following through on one's commitments rather than merely paying lip service to them. Ironically, it more definitively showcases the Western perspective on mercy. Hell represents the ultimate and absurdly cruel form of punishment. In this parable, mercy is given as an opportunity early on but not as a reminder.

Certainly, the suitors of Penelope were aware of their own wrongdoing and had the opportunity to repent prior to judgment day. Perhaps they were not aware of when judgment day would come or even began to believe that it would never come, but they would struggle to deny the possibility had not occurred to them. In other words, the suitors acted within the knowledge of a contract that their actions would invoke the rage of Odysseus, given his return. Indeed, these suitors might be likened to vultures, opportunistic rather than devious, but regardless, they were given a trial.

Let us now color the discussion of mercy and heroics, but through a more cheerful contemporary example, Bilbo Baggins. While Bilbo Baggins could be considered heroic through his wit, as is so often considered of Odysseus, let us ponder his act of Sparing Gollum instead. To do so, consider the following scene:

Frodo: 'It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill Gollum when he had the chance.'

Gandalf: 'Pity? It's a pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play in it, for good or evil, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.'

Here Gandalf wisely posits that the totality of the circumstances are difficult to ascertain, especially in the aftermath. Gandalf is not arguing that sparing Gollum was correct, but rather supposing that neither he, nor anyone else can truly know what is right and wrong until it’s all over with. This chain of uncertainty spirals quickly, so judgment is thus best left ungiven.

Therefore, while a hero’s judgment may come, it is not a hero's duty to cast it. A hero is a protector, not a slayer. As in Odysseus, a hero chooses to protect their family. As in Achilles, a hero chooses to protect their ideals. As shown in The Hobbit, a hero can also refrain from drastic action altogether. A hero is one who chooses to do good to the extent that they understand it. Thus we conclude, heroics are in conscious choices.

 

Best,
Ean
