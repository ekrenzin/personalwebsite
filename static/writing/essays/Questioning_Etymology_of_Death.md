## Questioning the Etymology of Death

How death is regarded in each civilization is a dubious question, as death naturally has a shifting ontology as societies develop. With that said, relics of the past give us snapshots of society's perspective, contemporary relative to the artifact or document. The Egyptian “Book of the Dead” and the Mesopotamian “Epic of Gilgamesh” are examples that delineate their respective civilization's contemplations on death. These two artifacts make it clear that humans come to terms with death in vastly different and polarizing ways, especially in contrast with modern Western beliefs.

The "Book of the Dead" occupies a distinctive niche in ancient Egyptian thought. It's not just a text but a codified philosophy, mummifying their relationship with mortality. For Egyptians, death wasn't an end, but a journey to a different form of existence. Central to this perspective was the principle of "ma'at." More than just balance, ma'at underscored the imperative of existence. In the solemn ceremony of death, one's heart—symbolizing a lifetime's deeds—was balanced against the feather of ma'at, a testament to the profundity of living with integrity. These abstract philosophies found concrete expression in the society's grand funerary tableau. Mummification wasn't mere preservation; it was a rite of passage. Pyramids were more than tombs; they were aspirations for an eternal legacy. 

The "Epic of Gilgamesh" a classic of ancient Mesopotamian literature, offers a narrative that contrasts starkly but culminates similarly with the Egyptian codified rituals. This epic is a poignant odyssey into the human psyche's confrontation with mortality. When Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk, faces the bleak shadow of death through the demise of his comrade Enkidu, a profound existential crisis ensues. His quest, fervently seeking the elixir of immortality, becomes emblematic of humanity's perpetual struggle against the march of time. Yet, as Gilgamesh's journey unfolds, a revelation dawns. Immortality is not defying death's embrace but rather lies in legacy. In this way, the story of Gilgamesh teaches a lesson akin to the “Book of the Dead.” 

In modern Western societies, the concept of death often evokes fear and is largely medicalized, quarantined away in hospices and hospitals. This contrasts sharply with the grand ceremonies of ancient Egypt and the existential odyssey in Mesopotamia. Where the Egyptians saw an eternal journey, contemporary (non-religious) views often fixate on finality rather than a continuation. Unlike Gilgamesh, who sought to etch his legacy in time, the modern Western focus is frequently on extending life through medical intervention, often without contemplating the significance of the legacy left behind. The contrast reveals a society much engaged in prolonging life but less immersed in the question of what that life means. 

Undoubtedly, when we consider instead the perspective of contemporary religious thinkers, this evaluation can be prodded, and holes unmasked. As in all things, humans operate on a gradient. I would argue that the 20th century has largely eliminated our roots through conflict on a scale unfathomable to nations of ancient history. Modern artifacts, especially after WW1 reflect this deviation. For example, Fountain by Marcel Duchamp, and other avant-garde artwork post WW1, highlight the hopelessness and lack of purpose which has grown and brewed, perhaps since Nietzsche. Perhaps what becomes most clear in the modern context, however, is that we have more ideas or records of ideas than ever before. In that sense, while generally less optimistic, the modern perspective of death has diversified. Thus we see that Humans come to terms with death in various ways, and while culture is a way to categorize these perceptions, overall death can be understood to have a shifting ontology.
