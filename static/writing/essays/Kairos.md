## Kairos: Seizing the Opportune Moments in the Tapestry of Chronos

Michel Foucault provides us with an intriguing perspective on the nature of history in the preface of his seminal work History of Madness. He posits that “The great œuvre of the history of the world is indelibly accompanied by the absence of an œuvre, which renews itself at every instant, but which runs unaltered in its inevitable void the length of history.” This profound statement paints a vivid picture of history as an ephemeral and transformative process, which, like an ever-evolving masterpiece, is inextricably linked to an underlying void that endures unaltered. In the heart of this interplay between the fleeting and the unchanging, we find Kairos. Derived from ancient Greek, Kairos refers not to chronological time, known as Chronos, but to the opportune moment or the right time for something to occur. More than a measure of seconds, minutes, or years, Kairos is capturing and understanding the essence of fleeting moments, extracting meaning and value from the seemingly meaningless progression of time. Kairos embodies the singular, phenomenological moments that offer potential for change and reinterpretation. It is in the distinction from Chronos – the predictable, the relentless – that Kairos shines. 

Chronos, unlike Kairos, has a fixed ontology. Chronos is the constant unalterable flow of time; it is the passage of time itself. To further illustrate this concept, we can turn to Plato's exploration of fixed ontology in his work, the Republic wherein he uses the metaphor of three types of beds. Here, Plato introduces the divine bed, which symbolizes the ultimate form or ideal; the carpenter's bed, embodying the physical manifestation of this ideal; and the artist's bed, which is nothing more than an imitation or representation of the initial ideal. Each of these beds signifies a different level in the hierarchy of reality, as envisioned by Plato. By equating Chronos to the divine bed, the loftiest in this hierarchy, we can perceive Chronos as the immutable, ultimate form of time. The constancy and absoluteness of Chronos parallel the divine bed's ideal and unwavering existence, encapsulating the true essence of a fixed ontology. In contrast, Kairos would embody the bed of the carpenter, constructed to fit the needs of its maker, which can be seen in Nietzsche's ethereal perspective of the human intellect and its place in nature. In On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense Nietzsche states, “When it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened” (Nietzsche 3). In the lens of Plato’s metaphor, while the carpenter’s wood bed will rot, the bed of heaven will never tarnish. Thus, the Kairotic human existence is of the body, since inevitably it will decay and be forgotten such that it will “not have happened.” In essence, Chronos provides the canvas upon which humans paint their tapestry of existence, transcending the limitations of fixed ontology.

Kairos offers a transformative perspective on time, challenging the linear and deterministic nature of Chronos. While Chronos implies an infinite and nihilistic view of time, Kairos introduces a dynamic ontology that emphasizes the phenomenological significance of each moment as it unfolds into the next. It is important to note that not every moment is Kairotic; rather, Kairos embodies the god of Opportunity from Greek antiquity. As the anonymous Greek author poignantly stated in the “Dissoi Logoi,” “nothing is fine or shameful in every way, but occasion takes the same things and makes them shameful or changes them to fine”. In this sense, Kairos represents a human adaptation to the opportune moment, akin to a skilled craftsman fashioning a bed tailored to their needs, as opposed to the perfect celestial bed of Plato's metaphor. Kairos, therefore, encompasses our interpretation and intentional engagement with occasions. Moreover, Kairos defies linearity and predictability due to its phenomenological nature. Kairos operates in infinite possibilities, recorded as brushstrokes across the canvas of Chronos. 

Having just argued that Kairos is a phenomenological concept, I want to complicate the point by analyzing the epistemological dimension of Kairos. This complexity emerges from the relative nature of 'right' and 'wrong,’ which hinge on relative experiences. The “Dissoi Logoi” encapsulates this, stating, “Everything done on the right occasion is fine and everything done on a wrong occasion is shameful”. However, as the “Dissoi Logoi” illustrates through various cultural contrasts, these notions of right and wrong can be contradictory, a subjective perspective shaped by cultural backgrounds and personal experiences. “For example, among the Spartans it is fine for young girls to practice athletics … whereas for the Ionians it is shameful”. To fully grasp the nuanced nature of Kairos, which denotes the application of the correct action at the apt moment, we must avoid falling into the trap of survivorship bias, or the tendency to focus predominantly on successful outcomes while overlooking failures. In this context, survivorship bias tempts us to equate 'right' action with successful outcome, denying the potential brilliance of unsuccessful ventures. Taking a cue from Foucault, we must also consider how deviations from established norms, or what he referred to as 'madness,' can reshape our understanding of concepts such as Kairos. Foucault posits that, “If madness drags everyone into a blindness where all bearings are lost, then the madman by contrast brings everyone back to their own truth”. In the perspective of Foucault, it is the madman's deviation from societal norms that prompts a shift in societal epistemology. Consequently, we should view Kairos not as an objective measure of rightness or wrongness, but as an action observed in its specific context, or 'occasion.' It exists solely within that occasion, and its value or impact cannot be pre-judged as right nor wrong. Kairos has circumstantial proprietary. Kairos’s existence, as a discrete action, comes into being only when recorded within the linear time framework of Chronos, and is consumed by time like Cronus’s sons, at birth.

To further illustrate circumstantial proprietary, we may consider the embodiment of Kairos in artistic expressions through Gene Kelly in “Summer Stock Newspaper Dance.” Gene Kelly’s whimsical dance routine begins with a whistling routine that is abruptly interrupted by the creaking of a floorboard. As Gene Kelly toes the floorboard further, he develops the idea that rather than a flaw in the flooring, creaking can become a musical tool that he can leverage in his dance. Gene Kelly then begins a dance routine wherein he manipulates mundane objects to produce musical elements, such as the swooshing noise a newspaper makes as it is pushed across the floor by tap shoes. This highlights the subjectivity of Kairos, as contradictory actions by others at the same time could also have been Kairotic. For example, if the set producer were to leverage this “fault” to justify an increased budget for stage repairs. As there are an infinite number of perspectives posed in the “Dissoi Logoi,” there are an infinite number of ways one could leverage a moment to their benefit. It is in this distinction that we identify that Kairos has circumstantial proprietary. 

In conclusion, the interplay between Chronos and Kairos forms a complex tapestry of human existence. Kairos, derived from ancient Greek philosophy, offers an alternative and transformative perspective on time that contradicts the linear, absolute ontology of Chronos. It invites us to look beyond the apparent void of the historical process, as proposed by Foucault, to seek moments ripe with potential and meaning. These Kairotic moments, akin to the carpenter's bed in Plato's metaphor, are flexible, tailored to their maker's needs, and inevitably ephemeral in the face of the immutable Chronos. Furthermore, the nuanced, relative nature of these moments, as encapsulated in the “Dissoi Logoi,” cautions us against overly simplistic notions of right and wrong, success and failure. Instead, it challenges us to appreciate the specific context or 'occasion' in which each Kairotic moment is born. Kairos is not an objective clock, but an interpretive dance, choreographed by circumstantial proprietary. It serves as a reminder that even within the unyielding march of Chronos, the individual and collective narratives we weave can alter, enrich, and redefine our experience of time. As we confront the ephemerality of our existence within the inexorable passage of Chronos, it is through Kairos that we can seize the reins, capturing and creating moments imbued with profound meaning and transformative potential. Thus, our understanding of history, time, and reality can be ever-evolving, much like the œuvre that accompanies and renews itself throughout the history of the world.
