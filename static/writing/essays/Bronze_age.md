## Barbara's Bronze's

INTRODUCTION
The Bronze age followed the Neolithic Age. Bronze is an amalgam of copper and tin. Bronze not only withstands the passage of time, but it also lends itself to the creation of diverse decorative items, tools, and even weapons. Recently, a nearly perfectly preserved bronze sword was uncovered and went viral (Reddit.com). Bronze works are frequently dug up in nearly mint condition with a beautiful patina because they do not oxidize or rust as iron does. The Bronze Age left a beautiful legacy of artifacts. It was eventually superseded by the iron age.

Two principal methods shape this versatile alloy: casting and forging. The latter involves the process of heating the metal, rendering it malleable, then deftly shaping it with the use of hammers and various instruments. In contrast, casting involves melting the bronze until it transforms into a molten river of liquid metal, which is then guided into a pre-shaped mold. Most notably, casting is the chosen method for many who dabble in bronze sculpting, for it enables the realization of intricate designs that would be challenging, if not impossible, to forge. A notable process within this method is lost-wax casting. “Lost-wax casting, as opposed to hammering or engraving sheets of metal, is a technique for the creation of three-dimensional objects and sculpture in which liquefied bronze is poured into a mold, where it adopts the form of the interior of the mold”. Interestingly, this process sometimes allows for the mold to be reused, facilitating multiple castings. 

Upon delving into the world of art history and bronze sculpture, I learned of a remarkable piece known as "Bird in Space" by Constantin Brancusi. The way Brancusi manipulated heavy materials to appear almost weightless in his work was fascinating and inspiring. In researching bronze sculpture, I stumbled upon the works of Dame Jocelyn Barbara Hepworth, more commonly referred to as Barbara Hepworth. Looking at her work, I experienced the same sense of wonder; upon further research, the feeling continued to elevate. Like Brancusi, Hepworth employed the lost-wax casting method to create her bronze statues. While Hepworth's repertoire isn't limited to bronze sculptures, or even sculpting, her expertise in handling this metal is undeniable and has resulted in some truly stunning pieces. What sets her work apart, and indeed, what drew me to her, is the diversity of the visual elements she creates using bronze. The way she incorporates holes, voids, and hollow spaces in her work brings to mind the controversy and discussion surrounding Anish Kapoor. As such, Hepworth's work, with its blend of technical proficiency and artistic innovation, would be the ideal conclusion to my study and exploration of bronze sculpture.

Barbara Hepworth was born in Wakefield, England in 1903. From a young age, she had a profound connection to landscapes and natural forms, and art. She writes of this connection, stating “This sensation has never left me. I, the sculptor, am the landscape. I am the form. And I am the hollow, the thrust, and the contour. Perhaps what one wants to say is formed in childhood. And the rest of one's life is spent in trying to say it”. Indeed, Hepworth spent the rest of her life trying to say it. Hepworth attended Leeds School of Art, where she met fellow artist Henry Moore, who would remain a lifelong friend and competitor. Her talent was quickly recognized, and she won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. In the 1920s and 1930s, Hepworth, along with her first husband John Skeaping and later her second husband Ben Nicholson was among a pioneering group of British sculptors. Hepworth's work was influenced by European Modernism and the ancient civilization of Greece, leading her to simplify forms to their purest, geometric shapes. Hepworth's technique of creating sculptures was transformative; she carved directly into stone and wood, and later adopted the lost-wax casting process to create bronze sculptures. Her work is notable for its hollow spaces, punctures, and beautiful, tactile surfaces. These characteristic features were inspired by her interest in the relationship between masses and voids, inside and outside, and the interplay of light and shadow. Ironically, Hepworth in her recordings and writings discusses “wholeness” rather than voids. Hepworth was deeply committed to the belief that art should be integrated with its environment. “And one is no longer aware of the detail, except as the necessary significance of wholeness and unity, a rhythm of form, which has its roots in earth, but reaches outwards towards the unknown experiences of the future. The thought underlying this form is, for me, the delicate balance, the spirit of man maintains between his knowledge and the laws of the universe. All landscape needs a figure.” Like a Greek tragedy, Hepworth passed away in 1975 (72 years old) in an inferno within her art studio (Alden Whitman). Her influence on the world of sculpture endures, and her works continue to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide.

## Barbara Hepworth, Ancestor I, 1970, bronze, 109" x 54" x 35-1/2" (277 x 137 x 90 cm)

“Ancestor I” by Barbara Hepworth is a commanding piece nearly 10 feet tall. It is comprised of 4 main sections, with a flat base. Sculpted in bronze, it displays a pleasant light green patina that contrasts with darker brown bronze. From the top down the four sections include: horizontal movement section emphasized by a central void and puncture; vertical movement section emphasized by a carved-out center; horizontal movement section emphasized by rib-like indentations; a final vertical movement section emphasized by a central pill shaped void. The statue appears nearly humanoid, embodying the notion of an ancestor, preserved in bronze, watching over the viewer. The piece could be personified to see the sections as a head, neck, chest, and lower body. The statue has variety, with each section introducing a new motif. There is a central balance, with a horizontal symmetry. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that each section is slightly askew, which disrupts the balance. While each element is held firmly in place, the piece reflects the delicate nature of balance. Stability is thus represented as something fragile. Furthermore, while the movement varies from section to section, it alternates forming a pattern and rhythm.

“Four-Square (Four Circles)” by Barbara Hepworth is a relatively humble piece, only ~2 feet tall, with a simplistic design of 4 stacked rectangles and her signature void punched through each, stood atop a bronze base. When analyzing this piece, it’s impossible not to notice the emphasis on the voids, rather than the squares. This fact is reflected in the name itself, where Hepworth ironically nests the words “Four Circles” within a literal circle (  ). While named four squares, there are not four squares. Each rectangle is varied from the others, most obvious in the height separation between the top two rectangles. By adding slight variations in size, in the squares and voids, the viewer’s eye is guided to the twister-like movement of the piece. The pattern of the shapes and alternating direction from the first layer to the second, create a rhythm that spins the eye.

"Horizontal Form" by Barbara Hepworth is a compact sculpture cast in polished bronze. “Horizontal Form” has a distinctive egg-like silhouette that defies conventional perspectives of the heaviness of metal. The piece, characterized by its curved back and a flat front face, incorporates Hepworth's signature motif: a hole punched through the center. Notably, the piece also contrasts sharp edges with curved ones. Consider the front – flat – in contrast with the back – rounded.  The side edges – flat – in contrast with the top and bottom edges – rounded. "Horizontal Form" studies contrast and balance, where asymmetry (variety) is key. On the left, the form is denser and visually heavier, conveying a sense of stability and grounding. This portion of the sculpture is a counterbalance to the ascending right side. In contrast, the right side extends upward and outward, a longer form that appears metaphorically lighter despite containing more weight literally. The differing weights and lengths on either side accentuate the piece's horizontal movement.

"Forms in Movement (Pavan)" by Barbara Hepworth embodies the core principles of Hepworth's work: fluidity, unity, and the inherent beauty of natural forms. The piece is cast bronze with a green and brown patina. The solidity of bronze contrasts sharply with the impression of movement it imparts. The sculpture itself draws inspiration from a previous work of Hepworth's, "Forms in Movement (Galliard)," which was crafted from polished copper. "Forms in Movement (Pavan)" is characterized by a series of circular formations that, in turn, converge on a fixed center. The overall impression is one of a spiral or vortex, creating an illusion of motion. The sculpture whirls the viewer's gaze, just as water swirls in the rapids of a river and pulls down. The piece's green-brown patina adds a natural element both via the symbolic green and the literal natural process of oxidation that occurs in metals. Just like a pavane (Pavan in England) - an elegant and slow dance popular in the 16th century - this piece embodies an elegant sense of movement, like a dance. Notably, this piece lacks Hepworth’s “hole punch” motif but still contains her use of voids. 

## Barbara Hepworth, Figure for Landscape, 1959-1960 bronze with a green/brown patina 102 3/8 in. (260 cm.)

"Figure for Landscape 1959–60," looms at a commanding nine feet tall. Cast in bronze, this hollowed-out piece presents a skeletal presence and visual movement akin to The Scream by Edvard Munch 1893. While it doesn't depict any explicit human form, the tapering shape invokes an abstract impression of a face. The piece has a slightly foreboding, yet intriguing quality. Hepworth's signature technique of voids is present, however "Figure for Landscape" lacks her visual motif of a “hole punch”. There are four asymmetrical openings to the hollow center of the sculpture. Starting with an aluminum armature, she built layer upon layer of plaster until the structure was solid. Upon drying, she directly carved into the plaster, reworking it continuously until the desired form was achieved. The final form was cast in bronze in two parts (Getty.edu). Hepworth's preference for working outdoors influenced her process and the final product. The piece guides light and wind gently through in a manner quite like the leaves of a plant or tree. Indeed, the figure’s silhouette is quite akin to that of an English Oak leaf. It is the emphasis on the center through her iconic voids that establishes a skeletal feel.
