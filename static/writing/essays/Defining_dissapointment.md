## Defining Disappointment 

> “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”  

Disappointment is an insidious feeling, as it first appears dressed as hope, pushing towards failure. Still, this harrowing emotion, akin to regret, is most often born from missed opportunities, rather than failed ones. Indeed, the fickle friend Life seems to toy with emotions as Chronos consumes the possibilities and converts chance into fact and fact into history. This is the oeuvre of life, akin to a thread that the Fates (Μοῖραι - Moirai) weave on a loom.  Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos watching, weaving, and then snipping. Such has been the fate of humans, and such will continue to be. Possibilities woven by choice into a tapestry of history. Each kairotic moment equally significant in terms of the time it consumes on the loom. Until the whole of history is played out and the gods can look at the finished masterpiece. However, these moments — equal from the perspective of the Fates — are far from equal to those who are woven. Indeed, most believe that lives have meaning and seek to perform an absurd form of calculus to maximize the meaning in their lives. Inevitably, the paths followed are different for all who partake in the quest for meaning. Some, like Gilgamesh, seek out the quest. Others, like Odysseus, are compelled by it. Swept into the tides of battle by obligation rather than choice. Caught in the storm and lost at sea, away from kin, until emerging all but unrecognizable to the family left behind. Disappointment is the sense of what could have been, had a choice been different. It is the quest not taken; the path untraveled. The neighbor who manifests a particularly seductive dress of saturated green across the street. How forlorn the quest to hop the fence; for many oases transform into a mirage before Aristotle’s tragic hero.  
 	
Thus, this perspective twists H. Jackson's buoyant optimism. However, rather than shackling, this perspective is of Nietzschean liberation.  Free will is precisely the nihilation of an optimal path. Free will is to tirelessly haul buckets of water for the plants on the side of the fence one beds, rather than fishing in endless seas. Quotes like H. Jackson’s, beautiful and encouraging, are ironic in effect. Certainly, hope is a component of life, but consider how realistic the opportunities are. So many lives are unequal to no fault of the thread itself. One can blame the Fates, as Homer writes in the Iliad “yet verily when he hath wept and wailed for him he maketh an end; for an enduring soul have the Fates given unto men.”  Or one can accept, endure, and affirm the innate strength and resilience of the human spirit as ordained by the Fates. Humans possess the inner fortitude to navigate life’s challenges. In this way, rejecting groundless optimism enables humanity to push the Sisyphean boulder with stability beneath each step.   

Yet, given free will to make choice, why is disappointment a possibility? If given the option to make the optimal choice, why would one set themselves up for regret? Dismissing masochism, perhaps the answer lies in the temporality of choice. In other words, the answer is lost in time. Even with the freedom to choose, humans are prone to regret—given time to forget their rationales. Twenty years having passed, the pains in one’s knees from the cold tile of retail are all but forgotten. Those pains are crippling in the moment. Yet, the unburdened future self will soon forget: Perhaps a stronger individual might have persevered and exercised after work. Doubts are fruitless explorations. Disappointment, therefore, is orphaned knowledge born for 
itself.  

Indeed, words such as Disappointment are loaded with rich context, connecting forms beyond themselves. Concluding the previous paragraph, the innocuous expression “for itself” carries the weight of existentialism.   Foucauldian philosophy instructs upon the constricting nature of allusion, such that allusion is but a veil. As Milton, master of allusion writes “So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs / Or dim suffusion veiled. Yet not the more / Cease I to wander where the muses haunt.”8 Consider thus far, on a meta-level, this prose has jumped epochs juxtaposing and alluding, to what effect? Synthesizing diverse realms of thought into a commentary on disappointment, to what effect? Repetition, to what effect? Disappointment is woven in between the lines of every commentary. When read back, does one not lament their choice of words? Perhaps not poignant enough, or too abstract a metaphor. Agonizing is the haunting of the muses. Thus writing is akin to a dance. Kairotic like Gene Kelly, an author guides the reader through a choreography of an idea, praying they continue to turn the page rather than avert their eyes.  When planning a dance, one can exhibit elegance, following a prompt like a waltz. Formalized, structured and adhering to expectation. The waltz is elegant and classical, but in the context of exploring, dreaming, and discovering, the waltz advances little. Meta-commentary, like choice, exists instead as an improvisational dance. The author acknowledges a prompt in passing and loosely adheres to it, whilst giggling with their partner as they throw their hands in absurdity.  

This choice of absurdity is my subjective manifestation of H. Jackson Brown’s quote. Certainly, one could explore the wide web of our world, or they could settle in a site they stake for their own. Doubtless, a safe harbor moors more ships than a perilous domain. And how delightful the tales of the sailors, given for free without the risk of Poseidon’s wrath. 

This freedom, however, is often grounded. Structure exists regardless of one’s ambition to shirk it, and adherence is rewarded. Epistemology and the social order are intimately intertwined.  Yet, the orthodox binding of the two is a Gordian knot, wherein social order constrains Epistemology.  In other words, one must not approach the problem as though it can be solved. Disappointment, being subjective, can become impossible to resolve. However, the anxiety of the future-self reflecting upon the past can experience magnanimity through a rejection of disappointment. As Aurelius writes “why should thoughts of ... future, trouble thy mind at all?”  Disappointment often stems from a discord between expectation and the present reality recorded by the Fates, a chasm widened by the constraints of societal norms and the pursuit of knowledge. Just as the Gordian knot symbolizes an intractable problem, the endeavor to decipher the complexities of life and its disappointments is equally labyrinthine. The key, perhaps, lies in embracing the journey itself rather than fixating upon the destination. By focusing on the process—our actions, decisions, and attitudes—we can find a sense of fulfillment and purpose, irrespective of the outcomes. To quote surfer lore: “The best surfer out there is the one having the most fun.”  

Thus, it is not the absence of choice but rather the consequence of choice that breeds disappointment. While initially the discussion sought to define disappointment, instead we have arrived at the footstep of happiness. Perhaps here the beauty of H. Jackson Brown’s quote finally unveils itself. When looking back, who is to say what one should, or should not have done. One can, however, look back and see if their experience was happy. But what is happiness? 

When Beowulf, the legendary Geatish hero, defeats the dragon he suffers a mortal wound. In this tragic moment Beowulf, disappointed by his lack of heir, passes on his legacy to his thane Wiglaf. Beowulf dies at ease, knowing that he has defended his people, and left a treasure hoard for them to thrive upon. Wiglaf in mourning and respect opts to bury the treasure, calling it as “useless to men as it ever was.”14 As such, Wiglaf, unlike Mammon recognized that material wealth is useless; as it were, money cannot buy happiness. 

When Gilgamesh, the mighty king of Uruk, faced the cruel sting of mortality through the loss of his dear friend Enkidu, his perspective on life and legacy underwent a profound transformation. This ancient hero, once consumed by the pursuit of glory and eternal renown, embarked on a harrowing journey to attain immortality. His quest, however, ultimately led him to the realization that earthly immortality was unattainable. Gilgamesh's ironic insight took him back to his roots of legacy. Gilgamesh realized that true essence of a lasting legacy does not exist within the permanence of one's physical existence; as it were, life for itself is not happiness. 

When Odysseus, the cunning hero of Ithaca, finally returned home after his long and arduous odyssey, he brought with him not just tales of mythical creatures and divine encounters, but also a deepened understanding of life's true value. His journey, filled with trials and tribulations, with beautiful women and sex, meant nothing without his family to tell tales to. By the time Odysseus returns to Ithaca, his men are dead and he is alone; as it were, life alone is not happy. 

Therefore, happiness is not found in the relentless pursuit of wealth, glory, or immortality. Instead, understanding and accepting the limitations of human life, cherishing personal relationships, and recognizing the impact of one's legacy will yield happiness. Rather than with disappointment, one should reflect with optimism and understanding. Happiness, as is Disappointment, is bound within a rich subjective context that even Socrates “know(‘s) literally nothing about”  In other words, even the greatest sophists have no answer to these questions. There are no right answers to the choices we make. Each choice is woven into history. The outcomes are unknown, so rather than regret, be optimistic. Remember Palamon and know that fate can always turn.
