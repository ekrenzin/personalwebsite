> To consume media today is to consume an endless parade of declarations, insistent beliefs, claims to knowledge and truth, debates that go nowhere.

---

### Note on Page 2 (Location 88)
> I want to argue that the very manner in which we form, share, and digest information is a symptom of a technology of language.

---

### Note on Page 3 (Location 104)
> From this perspective, nothing is more politically fraught than the manner in which we make sense of the world, than the technology we use to engage and process: than how we read the way of the world. I am calling this technology a form of reading—what I’m calling immanent reading. 2. The Making of Sense, or Exemplary Reading

---

### Note on Page 8 (Location 155)
> In all cases, we’re not reading the book in our hands. We’re reading something else as a way to make sense of this book right here and now.

---

### Note on Page 8 (Location 160)
> I call this mode of making sense—this turning away and seeking explanation from something bigger, this arborescent mechanics—exemplary reading. In exemplary reading, we make sense of things as an instantiation of something else.

> ideology critique. We read something in light of a predefined “cultural” or “ideological” category such as gender, race, sexuality, Marxism, psychoanalysis.

---

### Note on Page 10 (Location 193)
> Exemplary reading rests on the assumption of assumption, that there are certain things we can just count on. Why? Because experts have told us.

---

### Note on Page 10 (Location 196)
> We assume that our own faculties, our minds and imaginations and capacities to feel, are not enough. And, frankly, often they aren’t. Most of us are filled with idiocy we never question.

---

### Note on Page 12 (Location 217)
> How we make sense of things (what philosophers call epistemology) and who makes sense of things (the social order) are intimately intertwined.

---

### Note on Page 14 (Location 250)
> When we watch TV, we often seek to see ourselves. You’re a Rachel, we’ll tell someone after watching Friends, but I’m a Monica. That is, we seek ourselves. Rather than trying to explain Picasso through Freud, we try to make sense of Friends through the enormous shadow of ourselves—as if ourselves were one clear category.

---

### Note on Page 14 (Location 258)
> Exemplary reading, whether seeking basis in biography, ideology, theory, history, or ourselves, avoids the difference and newness and downright oddity of the things we experience. To make sense, we look backwards to the already known rather than looking to what’s in front of us and wondering: What new world flourishes here? 3. Making New Sense, or Immanent Reading

### Note on Page 19 (Location 321)
> The creator of a work is another possible reader who does not hold any authority over the sense of a text.

---

### Note on Page 19 (Location 328)
> Words are experiences that not even the speaker or writer of them owns. Once uttered, the words are in play, equally for everyone. We are all readers, even of ourselves.

---

### Note on Page 20 (Location 341)
> Once we remove the author—not the one who writes but the one who has authority over his writing—the very notion of a text and what it is to read that text changes dramatically:

---

### Note on Page 21 (Location 365)
> But immanent sense-making begins with a different conception of language, one in which words don’t just refer to things but are networked with things in complex and ever-different ways. A word is not a sign but a gesture, a creative act that distributes sense.

> “The amateur,” Marshall McLuhan writes, “can afford to lose” (93). That is, the amateur does not need to defend his position or sanction a field of knowledge. The amateur is free to spin the world, to say anything, to bring into play any elements. What does the amateur have to lose? As Shunryo Suzuki-Roshi says, “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.” The amateur sees possibilities where the expert shuts them down. 4. The Way of Things: Multiplicity, Affect, Style

> What we experience sensually, he maintained, cannot be trusted. Only what is conceptual and hence universal can be trusted, known, objective.

### Note on Page 32 (Location 517)
> The oeuvre of William Burroughs, for example, might include his “novels,” his essays, his interviews, his readings of his novels, his shotgun paintings, his cut-up poems, his collaborations with Brion Gysin and Kerouac, his letters to everyone, most notably to Ginsberg.

---

### Note on Page 33 (Location 538)
> Style is not determinative, at least not prior to the event or expression. 5. Things Happen

---

### Note on Page 43 (Location 664)
> A text is a Calder mobile: it has an infinite number of permutations depending on the environment, the nudge of the wind, the inertia of a spectator’s gaze.

---

### Note on Page 53 (Location 797)
> A tulip, for instance, offers a way of standing in the world, on one’s own without being excessively stern. Grass, meanwhile, instructs us how to be a network of individuals.

---

### Note on Page 54 (Location 822)
> If an exemplary reader scans the world looking for things that he can fit into his world—Oh, that’s deconstructive! That’s Deleuzian! That’s Buddhist!—the immanent reader discovers alien worlds, new ways of going, of operating, of being and becoming. 7. Good and Bad vs. Right and Wrong

---

### Note on Page 58 (Location 880)
> Burroughs, reading himself, takes issue with this characterization of his work: “To be an outlaw you must first have a base in law to reject and get out of. I never had such a base.”

---

### Note on Page 58 (Location 882)
> good reading is uncanny, taking the familiar and making it unfamiliar so you at once know and don’t know the thing. To see things, to think things, to sense things that you didn’t even know existed, to experience turns of thought, insights and twists, nuances and qualifications: a good reading is exhilarating. 8. Generosity

---

### Note on Page 65 (Location 965)
> Reading, then, is necessarily a matter of how things go together, of the very terms of engagement in this world.

---

### Note on Page 65 (Location 966)
> Reading is a matter of ethics.

---

### Note on Page 66 (Location 977)
> This is not a moral imperative and reading is not a moral exercise. It’s an ethical exercise. There is no code, no set of rules. There is only a very strange and beautiful principle: be generous.

---

### Note on Page 66 (Location 991)
> But this is different than the No-saying of the nihilists who say no to life. When Nietzsche says no, he is saying yes to his own becoming, to his own constitution, to his own intestinal health (which was poor). Sometimes, we affirm ourselves when we say no. It all depends on how we do it. 9. Power, or Saying No

---

### Note on Page 69 (Location 1015)
> Reading the social at times demands indifference, dissimulation, even conflict. Take walking down the street in any major American city. One is assaulted by oblivious or selfish drivers, the diseased, the distracted, the downright mean.

---

### Note on Page 71 (Location 1045)
> This does not mean one should always eat proverbial shit. There may be very good reasons—revolutionary or personal—for announcing your feelings. And, sometimes, this announcement may be dramatic, extreme, confrontational, even violent. But always ask yourself: What is the play here? How can I make sense of this situation so as to maximize it—not for the company or the boss or even for yourself per se but for the good of the world, for beauty and grace, for the moment and what it seems to be demanding? 10. Reading amidst the Social

---

### Note on Page 74 (Location 1086)
> This is the starting point of Gonzo journalism: join the fray, constitute the fray, be constituted by the fray as a way of knowing the world. The Gonzo journalist stands amongst his subjects, even getting stomped by some Angels. 11. Poise

---

### Note on Page 78 (Location 1134)
> The reader approaches a thing as if it were an unknown, with a certain and complex kind of stupidity: he assumes the text and nothing else. Before this text there’s no history or genre, there’s no such thing as people or religion or gender or earth—at least not for sure. 12. Diet

---

### Note on Page 84 (Location 1230)
> Sometimes, things that taste good, and even feel good, make us sick. Other times, things that taste bad, even feel bad, make us healthy—later (such as medicine). 14. Shedding Habit

---

### Note on Page 91 (Location 1325)
> People often ask children: “What’s your favorite color?” As if they are supposed to have a favorite color! But why can’t kids like all colors, or multiple colors, or different colors at different times for different occasions and different reasons?

---

### Note on Page 91 (Location 1328)
> To shed habit, we must question the question.

> Terence McKenna recommends smoking DMT. Three big puffs of this spirit molecule and you’re transported into other dimensions. In his words, you will be astonished—not just amazed but astonished: Under the influence of DMT, the world becomes an Arabian labyrinth, a palace, a more than possible Martian jewel, vast with motifs that flood the gaping mind with complex and wordless awe. Color and the sense of a reality-unlocking secret nearby pervade the experience. There is a sense of other times, and of one’s own infancy, and of wonder, wonder and more wonder. It is an audience with the alien nuncio. 15. A Thing among Things

### Note on Page 98 (Location 1430)
> It would equally be a mistake to think that Pollock does not read as he writhes over the canvas. After all, each drip navigates the circuit of viscosity—the viscosity of paint and of desire: this drip should be brown and go approximately there, this one white and dripping its drip here, and so on, even if chance plays its role as well. Pollock reads his own paintings as they emerge, a cog within the engine of his “own” paintings. 17. The Uncanny Time of Reading

---

### Note on Page 106 (Location 1522)
> Reading does not happen after a thing. There is not first a thing and then the reading. A thing is always already read, always already inscribed with glances, touch, thoughts, categories, knowledge, history. There is no pure this, no pure that. There are only things that go.

---

### Note on Page 106 (Location 1525)
> This is not to say that a thing only exists via human eyes, human experience. On the contrary, it is to say that human eyes, human senses, are always already touching. All things—humans, animals, arts, rocks, notions—are always already participating in the world, always already networked, always already networks themselves. A thing is always already making sense. 18. Words

---

### Note on Page 111 (Location 1605)
> Language, says Merleau-Ponty, is essentially physiognomic: “We have this acquisition [of language] as we have arms and legs” (Signs 19). In fact, “there is not a word, not a form of behavior which does not owe something to purely biological being” (M-P, PP 189). Words are particular and possible forms of bodily behavior, “one of the possible uses of my body. I reach back for the word as my hand reaches towards the part of my body which is being pricked” (180).

---

### Note on Page 114 (Location 1653)
> In Nietzsche’s early lectures on rhetoric, we encounter much the same argument. He declares in one early lecture, “There is obviously no unrhetorical ‘naturalness’ of language to which one could appeal; language itself is the result of purely rhetorical arts” (21). 19. Images

---

### Note on Page 117 (Location 1677)
> An image, like a word, is a way of going, of taking up the world—a face, a sunset, light, sadness, love, ambivalence, things—and assembling them just so. Like a word, an image selects, inflects, arranges, and prioritizes.

---

### Note on Page 121 (Location 1735)
> This is what makes Gursky’s photographs so foreboding: when we look at them, we are not witnessing an extension of our own eyes.

---

### Note on Page 121 (Location 1741)
> Gursky offers us camera-vision, utterly indifferent, without categorical distinctions other than the modulation of the visible. 21. Teaching Immanent Reading

---

### Note on Page 129 (Location 1835)
> Unfortunately, students are taught that to read a book involves learning some secret—especially “literature” and, even more, art and film which either “mean” nothing or else definitely take a very special and rare decoder ring.

---

### Note on Page 129 (Location 1841)
> And often they notice some interesting things such as a shift in voice from an “I” to a “we.” But they don’t know what to do with this piece of evidence. “So what?” I often scribble in the margins of their papers. “What happens when the voice shifts from first-person singular to first-person plural?” They usually then think that I’m contradicting myself: “You told us not to say what the text means. So I just wrote what I noticed.” “Yes,” I reply, “but you still haven’t told me how this work performs, what it does, how it works the reader over, what kinds of affects and effects it proffers. And, most importantly, you haven’t brought this text to life. You have not made me see it in a new light. You pointed something out I may have missed but you haven’t told me why I should care about it.”

### Note on Page 131 (Location 1869)
> focus on the relationship between what a text says and how it says it.

---

### Note on Page 132 (Location 1881)
> How is the book structured? The Canterbury Tales are structured quite differently than, say, War and Peace. Or take Nietzsche, for whom form is an explicit argument, his non-systematic approach a critique of systematic philosophy.

---

### Note on Page 134 (Location 1919)
> As with every art, practice is essential. The more one reads, the more one reads readings, the better one gets. 22. A Note on Rhetoric, with Reference to Foucault

---

### Note on Page 135 (Location 1922)
> The dictum of the sophists is strange and beautiful: Say the right thing at the right time. What’s so odd is that it at once proffers an absolute (the right thing) and a locality (at the right time).

---

### Note on Page 136 (Location 1938)
> It is, as Foucault discovers, “[ a] question of right use,” of doing the right or appropriate thing. And yet this propriety is not to be fixed: “It was much more a question of a variable adjustment in which one had to take different factors into account” (53). 23. Why Immanent Reading?

---

### Note on Page 139 (Location 1975)
> To read immanently means to stand towards things—towards the world, towards oneself—with a different posture: with poise and curiosity, with generosity and a will to multiplicity. It is to ask different questions: not “what does this mean?” but “what does this do?” Not “how does this fit into what I know?” but “how does this create new ways of knowing?” Works Cited
