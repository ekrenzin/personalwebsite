> I never heard of a vessel so decked out with battle weapons and the vestments of war, swords and corselets; on his breast lay gifts, treasures to take with him to the ocean, ornaments no less fine than those men gave who at the beginning cast him alone, though a child, on the face of the waters. Then they hoisted above him a flag of gold, and let him drift, wave-born, over the deep, leaving him to the ocean, and with grieving hearts mourning their loss. No one can say, neither counsellors-in-hall nor heroes under heaven, who it was received that cargo.

> ‘It is better to revenge a loss than to brood in mourning. For each one of us an end must come to living in this world. We must labour for renown and glory. When a warrior is gone that is his best memorial.

> Heorot soared, the hall vast and golden in the night; the guest slept until the raven proclaimed it sunrise and the shadows of the night were chased off by morning brightness.

> Tugging at its anchor, his ship waited for its master. On the journey Hrothgar was often praised, for generosity a matchless king, until old age took his strength away from him, as it does to all men. Part IV

> The mast towered over the cargo of heirlooms from Hrothgar’s hoard. Beowulf gave the guard who watched their ship a sword mounted with gold, a man who thereafter was more honoured on the mead bench with his treasure.

> The thanes are all gone. The iron helmet, hasped with bright gold, will lose its ornament; the retainers sleep who would polish battle masks. The mail-shirts that once withstood the bite of swords in the fray when the shield shattered, turn to dust with the warrior: the links will no longer range far and wide on the warlord’s back with his company. No humming harp remains now, no fierce hawk swoops about the hall, nor does a fleet horse paw the yard. Slaughter has emptied the earth of my people.’ So he mourned as he walked the world, lamenting day and night until death’s tide flooded his heart. Part VI

> The vile dragon, the under-earth robber of his life was robbed of life too, outright. No longer would its snake-coils twist about the gold in its treasure hoard: the hard-edged blade, the hammered battle iron had claimed it. Now the sky-roamer lay rigid, stilled, and brought to ground beside its treasure lair.

> ‘Who values truth would surely say the lord who granted you treasure and the war-gear you still wear, who bestowed the helmet and mail-shirt to his thanes in the mead-hall, the finest arms a prince could give a man, threw his gold away as if it were dung.

> ‘Often when one man pursues his own will alone many suffer for it. So it is now. Nothing we could say would counsel our lord, the prince we loved, guardian of our land to refuse combat with the gold-keeper, let it lie unmolested underground in darkness till the world came to an end. He held hard to his high destiny there. The hoard is bare but bitterly bartered. The fate was too cruel that brought him to this.

> After, they buried the neck torques of twisted gold and jewels, and a hoard of such treasured things as brave men had brought from the dragon lair after Beowulf died. They returned it to the ground that treasure and there it rests as useless to men as it ever was.
