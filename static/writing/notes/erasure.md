> “I’m working on a novel, I guess you’d call it a novel, which treats this critical text by Roland Barthes, S/ Z, exactly as it treats its so-called subject text which is Balzac’s Sarrasine.” 2

> The center of the tree is the heartwood. It does little to feed the tree, but it is the structural support. The sapwood, which feeds everything, is weak and prone to fungi and insect damage. The two look the same. But you want the heartwood. You always want the heartwood. 3

> I felt an inch tall because I had expected this young woman with the blue fingernails to be a certain way, to be slow and stupid, but she was neither. I was the stupid one.

> “I know who you’re talking about. That’s Tamika Jones. Tamika Jones actually has two children. The little boy with her today is named Mystery.” “Mystery?” “That’s right. And her daughter’s name is Fantasy.” “Mystery and Fantasy.” “Named after their fathers. One was a mystery and the other a fantasy.”

> The reality of popular culture was nothing new. The truth of the world landing on me daily, or hourly, was nothing I did not expect. But this book was a real slap in the face. It was like strolling through an antique mall, feeling good, liking the sunny day and then turning the corner to find a display of watermelon-eating, banjo-playing darkie carvings and a pyramid of Mammy cookie jars. 3 million dollars.

> For a second, I thought I saw the face of the man who had been staring at us from the bar in the restaurant, but then he was gone. 4

> Story idea—a man marries a woman whose name is the same as that of his first wife. One night while making love he says her name and the woman accuses him of calling out the name of his first wife. Of course he in fact has called out the name of his first wife, but also he has called out his present wife’s name. He tells her that he was not thinking of his first wife, but she says she knows what she heard.

> I looked at the calendar on the wall. It was from last year, but on the correct month. “Mother, that calendar’s out of date.” “Lisa keeps telling me that, but I can’t remember to change it.” “Tell you what, I’ll pick up a new one for you.” As I said it, I wondered what kind of grief I might cause Lisa by buying Mother a new calendar. Would the old lady go on and on about where it came from? I could imagine the months peeling by and Lisa having to endure, Would you look at that picture of the Grand Canyon. Monksie gave me that calendar. He noticed that the old one was out of date.

> “No thanks.” I blew on the tea and drank some. “So, are you meeting with your club much these days?” “Not so much. They’re all dying off. Young women aren’t interested in bridge anymore.”

> Anyone who speaks to members of his family knows that sharing a language does not mean you share the rules governing the use of that language. No matter what is said, something else is meant and I knew that for all my mother’s seeming incoherence or out-of-itness, she was trying to tell me something over tea. The way she had mentioned the smoke in the living room twice. Her calling the blue box gray. Her easy and quick capitulation to what it was she and her cronies actually did at their meetings. But since I didn’t know the rules, which were forever changing, I could only know that she was trying to say something, not what that something was.

> “You don’t sign it because you want people to know you painted it, but because you love it.” He was all wrong of course, but the sentiment was so beautiful that I wish to believe it now. What he might have been trying to say, I suppose, though he never would have even thought about it in these terms, was that art finds its form and that it is never a mere manifestation of life.

> The twists and turns of the novel are fascinating, but the real strength of the work is its haunting verisimilitude. 5

> “They shot her.” “What?” “Dr. Lisa is dead.”

### Note on Page 44 (Location 847)
> It’s incredible that a sentence is ever understood. Mere sounds strung together by some agent attempting to mean some thing, but the meaning need not and does not confine itself to that intention.

> A metaphor cannot be paraphrased.

> My gym teacher, whom I imagined eating rail spikes for breakfast, was gay and I knew it not because he held his hands a certain way, not because he made a pass at me, not because he would park himself by the showers and listen to us bathe, but because I saw him late one night walking hand in hand with another man. At first I was shocked, but I caught myself. What I really felt was envy. He seemed so happy, holding his friend’s hand, enjoying the evening. I wanted to hold a hand too, albeit a girl’s hand, but a hand nonetheless.

> My father had a term, which I heard once, for a homosexual man and that was Eye. I never did discover how the word came to mean anything.

> I remembered vividly making the box and hoping the while that she would like it as much I enjoyed constructing it. I lifted the lid and looked closely at the spalted maple inlay. It had darkened with age, but was still considerably lighter than the ebony box. There was one ring in the box and I guessed it had been Lisa’s wedding ring.

> Bill told me that he admitted to Sandy that he was gay and that she took him to court and took the kids, the house, the money, everything. He told me his practice was failing because everyone now knew he was gay.

> He said he lived in Arizona. He said: “Sandy actually deserves everything. I lied to her for fifteen years. I endangered her life, or so she believes. The judge believed her anyway. I’ve confused my children and it will take a while for them to be able to understand what’s happened. If they ever will. I deserve what I got. Which is, basically, nothing. I can’t look my kids in the eye. I owe more money than I make. And I live in Arizona.” My Pafology

> “What kind of doctor will I be, Father?” “A good one,” he said, as he had every other time she’d asked and it satisfied her. “And what about Bill?” I asked. To which Father replied, “I don’t know.” We ate on in silence. 9

> Father had been chewing and listening to us in that absent way of his. He looked at Lisa, then me, studying us, it seemed. He looked down the table to Mother, nodding his head. Then he looked longest at Bill. He then took us in as a group, and said, “Sight” with a smile that was not quite a smile, but enough for us to laugh as if we had been teased rather than insulted. 11

> Of course I felt bad for my brother and sister, but I felt worse for myself. I didn’t enjoy being so set apart and I was well aware, painfully aware, of the inappropriateness and incorrectness of Father’s assessment of me. At eighteen, I realized I was eighteen and not so smart or special, and that might have been the only way that I was in fact special. I found my own ideas poorly formed and repugnant, my self awkward and, more or less, for lack of a better word, geeky. In fact, my brother, second-year medical school student that he was, revisited his childhood and, when he passed in the hallway, muttered, “Geek.” 12

> Wittgenstein: Why did Bach have to sell his organ? Derrida: I don’t know. Why? Wittgenstein: Because he was baroque. Derrida: You mean because he composed music marked by elaborate and even grotesque ornamentation? Wittgenstein: Well, no that’s not exactly what I was getting at. It was a play on words. Derrida: Oh, I get it.

> Rauschenberg: Well, it took me forty erasers, but I did it. de Kooning: Did what? Rauschenberg: Erased it. The picture you drew for me. de Kooning: You erased my picture? Rauschenberg: Yes. de Kooning: Where is it? Rauschenberg: Your drawing is gone. What remains is my erasing and the paper which was mine to begin with. (Shows de Kooning the picture) de Kooning: You put your name on it. Rauschenberg: Why not? It’s my work. de Kooning: Your work? Look at what you’ve done to my picture. Rauschenberg: Nice job, eh? It was a lot of work erasing it. My wrist is still sore. I call it “Erased Drawing.” de Kooning: That’s very clever. Rauschenberg: I’ve already sold it for ten grand. de Kooning: You sold my picture? Rauschenberg: No, I erased your picture. I sold my erasing.
