> Perhaps poetry is another of science’s deepest roots: the capacity to see beyond the visible. Carnot names his first son after Saadi. Sadi Carnot is thus born out of poetry and rebellion.

> The crucial point here is the difference from what happens with falling bodies: a ball may fall, but it can also come back up, by rebounding, for instance. Heat cannot. This is the only basic law of physics that distinguishes the past from the future.

> In the elementary equations of the world, 13 the arrow of time appears only where there is heat.* The link between time and heat is therefore fundamental: every time a difference is manifested between the past and the future, heat is involved. In every sequence of events that becomes absurd if projected backward, there is something that is heating up.

> The growth of entropy is nothing other than the ubiquitous and familiar natural increase of disorder. This is what Boltzmann understood. The difference between past and future does not lie in the elementary laws of motion; it does not reside in the deep grammar of nature. It is the natural disordering that leads to gradually less particular, less special situations.

> The notion of “particularity” is born only at the moment we begin to see the universe in a blurred and approximate way.

### Note on Page Loss (Location Direction)
> entropy, as Boltzmann fully understood, is nothing other than the number of microscopic states that our blurred vision of the world fails to distinguish.

> Entropy is not an arbitrary quantity, nor a subjective one. It is a relative one, like speed.

> This, which is a fact, opens up the possibility that it wasn’t the universe that was in a very particular configuration in the past.

### Note on Page Perspective (Location Page)
> When we do science, we want to describe the world in the most objective way possible. We try to eliminate distortions and optical illusions deriving from our point of view. Science aspires to objectivity, to a shared point of view about which it is possible to be in agreement. This is admirable, but we need to be wary about what we lose by ignoring the point of view from which we do the observing. In its anxious pursuit of objectivity, science must not forget that our experience of the world comes from within. Every glance that we cast toward the world is made from a particular perspective.

> Living beings are made up of similarly intertwined processes. Photosynthesis deposits low entropy from the sun into plants. Animals feed on low entropy by eating. (If all we needed was energy rather than entropy, we would head for the heat of the Sahara rather than toward our next meal.) Inside every living cell, the complex web of chemical processes is a structure that opens and closes gates through which low entropy can increase.

> Happy and master of himself is the man who for every day of his life can say: “Today I have lived; tomorrow if God extends for us a horizon of dark clouds or designs a morning of limpid light, he will not change our poor past he will do nothing without the memory of events that the fleeting hour will have assigned to us.” (III, 29)

> In the Milinda Panha, a Buddhist text written in Pali in the first century of our era, Nāgasena replies to the questions of King Milinda, denying his existence as an entity: 106 King Milinda says to the sage Nāgasena: What is your name, Master? The teacher replies: I am called Nāgasena, o great king; Nāgasena is nothing but a name, a designation, an expression, a simple word: there is no person here. The king is astonished by such an extreme-sounding assertion: If no person exists, who is it then who has clothing and sustenance? Who lives according to the virtues? Who kills, who steals, who has pleasures, who lies? If there is no longer an actor, neither is there good or evil any longer. And he argues that the subject must be an autonomous being that is not reducible to its component parts: Is it the hairs that are Nāgasena, Master? Is it the nails or the teeth or the flesh or the bones? Is it the name? Is it the sensations, the perceptions, the consciousness? Is it none of these things? The sage replies that “Nāgasena” is effectively none of these things, and the king seems to have won the discussion: if Nāgasena is none of these, then he must be something else—and this something else will be the person Nāgasena who therefore exists. But the sage turns his own argument against him, asking what a chariot consists of: Are the wheels the chariot? Is the axle? Is the chassis the chariot? Is the chariot the sum of its parts?

> 3. But there is a third ingredient in the foundation of our identity, and it is probably the essential one—it is the reason this delicate discussion is taking place in a book about time: memory. We are not a collection of independent processes in successive moments. Every moment of our existence is linked by a peculiar triple thread to our past—the most recent and the most distant—by memory. Our present swarms with traces of our past. We are histories of ourselves, narratives.

> How can we come to know so clearly about the past, about time, if we are always in the present? Here and now, there is no past and no future. Where are they? Augustine concludes that they are within us: It is within my mind, then, that I measure time. I must not allow my mind to insist that time is something objective. When I measure time, I am measuring something in the present of my mind. Either this is time, or I have no idea what time is.

> The music of Strauss and the words of Hofmannsthal sing of this with devastating delicacy: 125 I remember a little girl . . . But how can that be . . . Once I was that little Resi, and then one day I became an old woman? . . . If God wills it so, why allow me to see it? Why doesn’t he hide it from me? Everything is a mystery, such a deep mystery . . . I feel the fragility of things in time. From the bottom of my heart, I feel we should cling to nothing. Everything slips through our fingers. All that we seek to hold on to dissolves. Everything vanishes, like mist and dreams . . . Time is a strange thing. When we don’t need it, it is nothing. Then, suddenly, there is nothing else. It is everywhere around us. Also within us. It seeps into our faces. It seeps into the mirror, runs through my temples . . . Between me and you it runs silently, like an hourglass. Oh, Quinquin. Sometimes I feel it flowing inexorably. Sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and stop all the clocks . . .

> Perhaps God has many more seasons in store for us—or perhaps the last is to be this winter that guides back the waves of the Tyrrhenian Sea to break against the rough pumice cliffs. You must be wise. Pour the wine and enclose in this brief circle your long-cherished hope. (I, 11)

> I believe, as Hans Reichenbach suggests in one of the most lucid books on the nature of time, The Direction of Time, that it was in order to escape from the anxiety time causes us that Parmenides wanted to deny its existence, that Plato imagined a world of ideas that exist outside of it, and that Hegel speaks of the moment in which the Spirit transcends temporality and knows itself in its plenitude. It is in order to escape this anxiety that we have imagined the existence of “eternity,” a strange world outside of time that we would like to be inhabited by gods, by a God, or by immortal souls.* The Sister of Sleep

> In the third part of the great Indian epic the Mahābhārata, a powerful spirit named Yaksa asks the oldest and wisest of the Pandava, Yudhistira, what is the greatest of all mysteries. The answer given resounds across millennia: “Every day countless people die, and yet those who remain live as if they were immortals.”

> Then the song fades and ceases. “The silver thread is broken, the golden bowl is shattered, the amphora at the fountain breaks, the bucket falls into the well, the earth returns to dust.” 132 And it is fine like this. We can close our eyes, rest. This all seems fair and beautiful to me. This is time.
