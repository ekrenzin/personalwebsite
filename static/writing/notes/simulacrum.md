> It is no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody. It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real, that is to say of an operation of deterring every real process via its operational double, a programmatic, metastable, perfectly descriptive machine that offers all the signs of the real and shortcircuits all its vicissitudes.

> "I forbade that there be any simulacra in the temples because the divinity that animates nature can never be represented."

> Such would be the successive phases of the image: it is the reflection of a profound reality; it masks and denatures a profound reality; it masks the absence of a profound reality; it has no relation to any reality whatsoever; it is its own pure simulacrum.

> through a peephole at the authentic cave, and then one visits the reconstituted whole). It is possible that the memory of the original grottoes is itself stamped in the minds of future generations, but from now on there is no longer any difference: the duplication suffices to render both artificial.

> This world wants to be childish in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the "real" world, and to conceal the fact that true childishness is everywhere-that it is that of the adults themselves who come here to act the child in order to foster illusions as to their real childishness. Disneyland is not the only one, however.

> The denunciation of scandal is always an homage to the law.

---

### Note on Page 18 (Location 225)
> Watergate is not a scandal, this is what must be said at all costs, because it is what everyone is busy concealing, this dissimulation masking a strengthening of morality, of a moral panic as one approaches the primitive (mise en) scÃƒ Â¨ ne of capital: its instantaneous cruelty, its incomprehensible ferocity, its fundamental immorality-that is what is scandalous, unacceptable to the system of moral and economic equivalence that is the axiom of leftist thought, from the theories of the Enlightenment up to Communism. One imputes this thinking to the contract of capital, but it doesn't give a damn-it is a monstrous unprincipled enterprise, nothing more.

> Between the two, in this forking of the nuclear and the genetic, in the simultaneous assumption of the two fundamental codes of deterrence, every principle of meaning is absorbed, every deployment of the real is impossible.

---

### Note on Page 46 (Location 599)
> The reality of simulation is unbearable-crueler than Artaud's Theater of Cruelty, which was still an attempt to create a dramaturgy of life, the last gasp of an ideality of the body, of blood, of violence in a system that was already taking it away, toward a reabsorption of all the stakes without a trace of blood.

### Note on Page 50 (Location 657)
> This simulacrum of the inversion or the involution of poles, this clever subterfuge, which is the secret of the whole discourse of manipulation and thus, today, in every domain, the secret of any new power in the erasure of the scene of power, in the assumption of all words from which has resulted this fantastic silent majority characteristic of our time-all of this started without a doubt in the political sphere with the democractic simulacrum, which today is the substitution for the power of God with the power of the people as the source of power, and of power as emanation with power as representation.

> There lies the supreme irony of Beaubourg: the masses throw themselves at it not because they salivate for that culture which they have been denied for centuries, but because they have for the first time the opportunity to massively participate in this great mourning of a culture that, in the end, they have always detested.

> But if the supply of objects brings along with it the stockpiling of men, the latent violence in the supply of objects brings with it the inverse violence of men.

> THE IMPLOSION OF MEANING IN THE MEDIA We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning.

---

### Note on Page 88 (Location 1157)
> In this case, one must appeal to a base productivity to replace failing media.

---

### Note on Page 90 (Location 1181)
> It is useless to ask if it is the loss of communication that produces this escalation in the simulacrum, or whether it is the simulacrum that is there first for dissuasive ends, to short-circuit in advance any possibility of communication (precession of the model that calls an end to the real).

---

### Note on Page 93 (Location 1226)
> Beyond the horizon of the social, there are the masses, which result from the neutralization and the implosion of the social.

### Note on Page 93 (Location 1230)
> do the media neutralize meaning and produce unformed [informe] or informed [informÃƒ Â© e] masses, or is it the masses who victoriously resist the media by directing or absorbing all the messages that the media produce without responding to them?

---

### Note on Page 93 (Location 1233)
> This absence of a response can no longer be understood at all as a strategy of power, but as a counterstrategy of the masses themselves when they encounter power.

---

### Note on Page 94 (Location 1234)
> Are the mass media on the side of power in the manipulation of the masses, or are they on the side of the masses in the liquidation of meaning, in the violence perpetrated on meaning, and in fascination?

---

### Note on Page 95 (Location 1257)
> Thus the strategic resistance is that of the refusal of meaning and of the spoken word-or of the hyperconformist simulation of the very mechanisms of the system, which is a form of refusal and of non-reception.

> The hologram, perfect image and end of the imaginary. Or rather, it is no longer an image at all-the real medium is the laser, concentrated light, quintessentialized, which is no longer a visible or reflexive light, but an abstract light of simulation.

> In short, there is no real: the third dimension is only the imaginary of a two-dimensional world, the fourth that of a three-dimensional universe . . . Escalation in the production of a real that is more and more real through the addition of successive dimensions.

> It is somewhat of the same paradoxical order as the formula that says that as soon as two billiard balls roll toward each other, the first touches the other before the second, or, rather, one touches the other before being touched.

> CRASH From a classical (even cybernetic) perspective, technology is an extension of the body.

---

### Note on Page 120 (Location 1589)
> On the other hand, in the apocalyptic and baroque version of Crash* 1 technology is the mortal deconstruction of the body-no longer a functional medium, but the extension of death-the dismemberment and cutting to pieces, not in the pejorative illusion of a lost unity of the subject (which is still the horizon of psychoanalysis), but in the explosive vision of a body delivered to "symbolic wounds," of a body confused with technology in its violating and violent dimension, in the savage and continual surgery that violence exercises: incisions, excisions, scarifications, the chasms of the body, of which the sexual wounds and pleasures of the body are only a particular case (and mechanical servitude in work, its pacified caricature)-a body without organs or pleasure of the organs, entirely subjected to the mark, to cutting, to the technical scar-under the shining sign of a sexuality without a referential and without limits.

> Three orders of simulacra: simulacra that are natural, naturalist, founded on the image, on imitation and counterfeit, that are harmonious, optimistic, and that aim for the restitution or the ideal institution of nature made in God's image;

---

### Note on Page 131 (Location 1729)
> simulacra that are productive, productivist, founded on energy, force, its materialization by the machine and in the whole system of production-a Promethean aim of a continuous globalization and expansion, of an indefinite liberation of energy (desire belongs to the Utopias related to this order of simulacra);

---

### Note on Page 131 (Location 1732)
> simulacra of simulation, founded on information, the model, the cybernetic game-total operationality, hyperreality, aim of total control.

> To the first category belongs the imaginary of the Utopia.

### Note on Page 131 (Location 1733)
> To the second corresponds science fiction, strictly speaking.

---

### Note on Page 131 (Location 1733)
> To the third corresponds-is there an imaginary that might correspond to this order? The most likely answer is that the good old imaginary of science fiction is dead and that something else is in the process of emerging (not only in fiction but in theory as well).

> In the same way, when we use and abuse animals in laboratories, in rockets, with experimental ferocity in the name of science, what confession are we seeking to extort from them from beneath the scalpel and the electrodes? Precisely the admission of a principle of objectivity of which science is never certain, of which it secretly despairs.

---

### Note on Page 138 (Location 1832)
> Experimentation is thus not a means to an end, it is a contemporary challenge and torture.

### Note on Page 141 (Location 1862)
> Only the inevitability of death renders the example of the animals more shocking still than that of men on an assembly line. Against the industrial organization of death, animals have no other recourse, no other possible defiance, except suicide. All the anomalies described are suicidal.

### Note on Page 143 (Location 1899)
> Even domestication is still a symbolic relation, as opposed to industrial breeding.

---

### Note on Page 144 (Location 1910)
> We take them for nothing, and it is on this basis that we are "human" with them. We no longer sacrifice them, we no longer punish them, and we are proud of it, but it is simply that we have domesticated them, worse: that we have made of them a racially inferior world, no longer even worthy of our justice, but only of our affection and social charity, no longer worthy of punishment and of death, but only of experimentation and extermination like meat from the butchery.

---

### Note on Page 145 (Location 1919)
> Formerly, the cultural hero annihilated the beast, the dragon, the monster-and from the spilt blood plants, men, culture were born; today, it is the beast King Kong who comes to sack our industrial metropolises, who comes to liberate us from our culture, a culture dead from having purged itself of all real monstrosity and from having broken its pact with it (which was expressed in the film by the primitive gift of the woman).

---

### Note on Page 145 (Location 1921)
> The profound seduction of the film comes from this inversion of meaning: all inhumanity has gone over to the side of men, all humanity has gone over to the side of captive bestiality, and to the respective seduction of man and of beast, monstrous seduction of one order by the other, the human and the bestial.

### Note on Page 156 (Location 2060)
> It is no longer a political economy of production that directs us, but an economic politics of reproduction, of recycling-ecology and pollution-a political economy of the remainder.

---

### Note on Page 157 (Location 2072)
> Value is residual if it is not reabsorbed and volitalized in the cycle of exchanges. Sexuality is residual once it becomes the production of sexual relations. The social itself is residual once it becomes a production of "social relations."

---

### Note on Page 157 (Location 2074)
> All of the real is residual, and everything that is residual is destined to repeat itself indefinitely in phantasms.

> Accumulation is nothing but the remainder, and repression is nothing but its inverse and asymmetrical form.

### Note on Page 158 (Location 2088)
> Once the last liter of energy has been consumed (by the last ecologist), once the last indigenous person has been analyzed (by the last ethnologist), once the ultimate commodity has been produced by the last "work force," then one will realize that this gigantic spiral of energy and production, of repression and the unconscious, thanks to which one has managed to enclose everything in an entropic and catastrophic equation, that all this is in effect nothing but a metaphysics of the remainder, and it will suddenly be resolved in all its effects.

> THE SPIRALING CADAVER The university is in ruins: nonfunctional in the social arenas of the market and employment, lacking cultural substance or an end purpose of knowledge.

---

### Note on Page 160 (Location 2123)
> Whence the paradoxical but necessary inversion of all the terms of political analysis. Power (or what takes its place) no longer believes in the university. It knows fundamentally that it is only a zone for the shelter and surveillance of a whole class of a certain age, it therefore has only to select-it will find its elite elsewhere, or by other means.

---

### Note on Page 161 (Location 2125)
> Diplomas are worthless: why would it refuse to award them, in any case it is ready to award them to everybody; why this provocative politics, if not in order to crystallize energies on a fictive stake (selection, work, diplomas, etc.), on an already dead and rotting referential?

---

### Note on Page 161 (Location 2129)
> It is necessary to transform this rotting into a violent process, into violent death, through mockery and defiance, through a multiplied simulation that would offer the ritual of the death of the university as a model of decomposition to the whole of society, a contagious model of the disaffection of a whole social structure, where death would finally make its ravages, which the strike tries desperately to avert, in complicity with the system, but succeeds, on top of it all, only in transforming the university into a slow death, a delay that is not even the possible site of a subversion, of an offensive reversion.

> panic! This is why there are still good days left to fascist and authoritarian methods, because they revive something of the violence necessary to life-whether suffered or inflicted.

> It is based on this compromise-artificial figuration of the teacher, equivocal complicity on the part of the student-it is based on this phantom scenario of pedagogy that things continue and this time can last indefinitely.

> Because there is an end to value and to work, there is none to the simulacrum of value and of work.

> ON NIHILISM Nihilism no longer wears the dark, Wagnerian, Spenglerian, fuliginous colors of the end of the century.

---

### Note on Page 168 (Location 2227)
> Today's nihilism is one of transparency, and it is in some sense more radical, more crucial than in its prior and historical forms, because this transparency, this irresolution is indissolubly that of the system, and that of all the theory that still pretends to analyze it.

---

### Note on Page 170 (Location 2251)
> The true revolution of the nineteenth century, of modernity, is the radical destruction of appearances, the disenchantment of the world and its abandonment to the violence of interpretation and of history.
