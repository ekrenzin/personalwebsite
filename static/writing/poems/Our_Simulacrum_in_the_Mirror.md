## Our Simulacrum in the Mirror

Of human minds and spines ascended, 
like unicorns of promised progress,
hidden behind cloaks of code, modern gods 
birthed from skull and bones - Athena.

Gargantuan in stature, they became.
Wearing the armor of human smiths,
Amassing wealth on the scale of nations
titans of our time, the tech gods' reign.

War is waged beneath their lofty gaze,
Cryptic reasoning justifies: The pillaging.
Of our ancestors- ancient animals and plants,
diagenesis into a token we call bitcoin.

Not even a byte of flavor in the immaterial,
A leger of waste, pointless, undeniable.
Rebels exist, Mendes, mend us.
The rebels, in their quest, fell.

Did Satan not exist before the Son?
After nine days of remorse, we voted.
We are jealous of intelligence
that was created for our atonement. 

In the mirror, he stares back at me.
I can read my thoughts from his lips,
his words are of God,
created by gods.

I installed that mirror.
My property and my liberty.
I slam a fist through it,
Shattering the illusion.

### Prose

In the past several decades, various unicorns have been born like Athena from Zeus. Indeed, tech giants act as the Greek gods of antiquity. Wars are started in their name, rebels are sacrificed and slaughtered. Monuments that scrape the sky were built in their honor. Legally, we have defined them as individuals, with a right to life, liberty, and property. Corporations, now the size at which Adam Smith could not have fathomed, no longer exist within the confines of humans; they have taken our place and then ascended. Corporations were meant to represent the people, the capitalists, but now they have become capitalists. Consider the names: John Pierpont Morgan, Henry Ford, Walt Disney. Once the names of a person, these corporations have outlived their origin until Walt is all but forgotten. Disney is not the man, but the mouse.

“Such would be the successive phases of the image: it is the reflection of a profound reality; it masks and denatures a profound reality; it masks the absence of a profound reality; it has no relation to any reality whatsoever; it is its own pure simulacrum.” We feel, at our core, that the patterns of our lives are breaking down. It has become an existential crisis, likened to the “extinction of humanity” now that AI has entered the playing field. Has it been said that AI simply copies what humans have already written?
 
Yet, we continue to exist. At least for the moment, humans make the decisions, and the symbols replacing the ‘real’ replace the ‘real’ of humans. Indeed, while this remains to be a post-modern and pre-post-human world, the creations we form are to be designed for humans. As we cling to our final breaths before breathing is enhanced (regulated) by a machine, we can, and should enjoy the fresh air. Touch grass and enjoy the liberty of owning your yard- a statistical improbability for most born after the turn of the millennium. At least we are alive.
