# # Bags under my eyes

There are bags under my eyes, big
Dark splotches of purple on leathery skin.
They are sunken-in like when you scoop powder and it leaves an imprint.
I feel my face shake when I step, my sinuses hollow.
It is as if my jaw is sliding around in there,
The muscle rotting away leaving only bone.
I can hear my face rattle, and the sounds are gray.

I remember a poem so beautiful, but itâ€™s gone.
So much is gone. It is as though I cannot remember anymore.
Perhaps all there is to remember is the feeling of tiredness.

Clouds are so beautiful until the sky is gray. Then I miss the blues.
