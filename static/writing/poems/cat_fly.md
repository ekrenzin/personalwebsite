## Cat

Cat stares outward, a paw draped over the dresser like a hook,
Lazily scooping the air, bailing out the tears sinking her ship.
She sees them in the air, the vespers of energy. Negativity that threatens.
Cat sees them in the air, and paws at them lazily. 
Itâ€™s beneath her,
As is most things. 
So much is beneath her when she drapes over the tall dresser.
High in the air, she can watch for her prey. 
A buzzing in the air. Her hook springs to life.
The awful fly, buzzing like a clock. 
Cat is angered by the ticking of the fly. 
As it slams its Miserable body of filth into a window. 
Over an over again. The fly is beneath cat too,
But it anger her. 
Flying close to her perch. Making a ruckus. 
Cat swats and the fly spirals down, like a wounded Goose it spirals down.
Exploding into the carpet. 
Cat leaps from her perch to execute the crippled beast.
With precision, it dies. 
Licking her paws clean, cat soars back to her perch.
Dangling her hook, with one eye open, and one ear perked up.
