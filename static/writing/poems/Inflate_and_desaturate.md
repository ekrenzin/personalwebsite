## Inflate and Desaturate

Much of the time, when I look at art, it leaves me deeply depressed. 
I see colors and they make me sad. When on a walk, I pause,
to glance up at the sky, in pastels and desaturated hues, tucking
the brilliant golden hills into sleep. The woodpeckers like
children frolic in the sky, “ashes ashes we all fall down.”

I’m forced to cry when the purple Martins swoop down as if they are
shackled too. As we all are. I think of how cruel it is that the
crow breathes the air I exhale, and we cycle together under the moon, 
But the sparrows soar, picked up by the current, lifted by the wind
and I laugh in delight at their beauty which is so playful.

And that is my condition, where color saturates and desaturates. 
And I am a deflated balloon whose helium escapes the mylar,
but could be refilled if given the chance. So fragile, nonetheless,
as the more I am inflated, the thinner my skin, inflated until
it would take just the kiss of a knife for me to pop.
