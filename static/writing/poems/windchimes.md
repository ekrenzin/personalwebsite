# wind chimes

Wrangling the nail onto the tree,
Ring and Thump. Ring and Thump.
The hammer hits the nail on the head

And then itâ€™s there, a nail in a tree,
A sliver of metal, silver like a scar,
But meaningful as a tattoo, Taboo too.

Wrap the little string around that nail,
And the wind chimes go up,
For their final resting place.

Hung.
