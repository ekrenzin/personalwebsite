The phone rings, my muscles tense in anticipation
sore from the day before, I stretch. Yawning, but I
am not tired. The phone rings. I sigh, knowingly.
I'm calling a cellphone, a flip phone, one that you could not
catch me dead with. My Grandmas new phone.
The phone rings. At this point it is clear that there will not be an answer.
I think about how eventually there will never be an answer.
This time it's temporary, but everything is temporary until it's not.
That comes up a lot at work, solutions to complete a job,
but not to do it well. I wanted to tell her about my week. 
It was a long one.
She has dementia, or Alzheimer's. Really she just has old age.
It's therapeutic to tell someone who you know will forget what you've said.
In a way, it's inspiring because it shows clearly what matters.
In the end, that hard week really did not matter, and when she forgets
I forget too, a bit.
I wonder how long I will remember her. I know it's forever,
but death becomes a fog. Will I remember the way she asked about school,
or how she tells me that she is doing a whole bunch of nothing?
The texture of her skin, which I have watched deepen.
What version of hair? Will I remember the years she went to get a perm, or instead
the coarser, straight, hair that she has now. Perhaps the hair I first met?
More likely, whatever photo of her I see the most.
And that's what life after death seems to be.
Photos and memories.
Grandma is a wrench in my plans to forget every day.
She is a moment I can't forget, and don't want to.
I worry though, that the floodgates are open without a filter.
Life is hard, and remembering it all would kill me.
So perhaps I can choose to remember one thing.
One thing alone, which is that she was here for me.
And perhaps this time she did not answer, but so many other times she did.
That was enough, and always will be. I'm so grateful that she answered, every week, for years.
