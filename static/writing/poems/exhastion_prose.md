## Exhaustion

Exhaustion is a nefarious beast. Insidious in that it creeps up on you, when you are most vulnerable. Vulnerable in your pleasure, or effort, that leaves you without time for rest. Exhaustion stabs you in the back when you have exerted your entire will, leaving nothing left. Naked on a table Exhaustion dissects you while you are awake. It injects you with tranquilizers to muffle the screams of your zeitgeist, the bleeding of your soul. That is exhaustion. Where the only way to pacify exhaustion is to rest, sacrificing your nascent obligations to the slaughter. A cruel transaction where someone must break. The shattered pieces on the floor are heartbreaking. Each piece with a mind, and an eye. Yet the fragments cannot see themselves, scattered across the floor. They cannot know their own pain. But looking at the fragments, what can you feel but pity.
