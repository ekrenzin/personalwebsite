## Foucault

The thirst for knowledge cannot be quenched.
Knowledge is blood that pools en-trenched until feet are drenched.
The perfect strategy where progress is blocked,
Till-ed earth is raptured and Shell shocked.

The hunger for knowledge is insatiable,
like dragons who pick their teeth with ribs of gold, 
Beasts who rip veins from faithful prey,
Starved slave, even vultures need pay.

Belief in history passed down by the old.
Knowledge has aged beyond its prime like mold.
Knowledge is a parochial minister whose soul is sold.

Knowledge exists but is an existential extension,
Pascal with gun to his head succumbs to a magician,
It’s paradox: wager and mugging,
duping, dropping, doping, and drugging.


The Author is the Capitalist of metaphor,
The Author is the perverted Pornographer.
The Author of, 
The Author in.

Of Media, that pumps terror and sends a nascent lamb to slaughter,
A man with hands in prayer to veil his daughter.
For efficiency which sucks fuel like milk from ewe,
The wool of sheep pulled over eyes like peekaboo.

In Eden, Milton’s chivalric heroine slits her wrist,
While you stretch the band and clench a fist.
But the sweetness of Paradise. Yet we have lost,
When we read, self is cost.

Knowledge is near.
Knowledge is here.
Knowledge of fear.
Knowledge in sight, in light, in might.
Knowledge is right,
and for Knowledge, we fight.
Without knowledge we are blind.

And that is how the Author will bind.
