## Hate

2023-12-17

Hate is agony, suffering through the wounds cut so deep. Wounds that are impossible to stitch shut, envious as we are of the macabre rag-doll. Hate scrapes bones until the sweetness of  marrow mixes with blood into an ambrosia, intoxicating. It is the nefarious thoughts. The insidious ideas which creep up. That idea which is hope. Hope is pain that you wish will become someone else's "you say, ‘Don’t do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so.’ That is the horrible thing about Hate. That it was impossible to avoid joining in." Hate is spawned from an intense suffering, to the degree one can wish for nothing more but to be relieved of pain. To hate a person, if it is true, is caused by suffering. Hate will ebb and flow, as do all emotions, but that hate it is felt at all, is tragic.

  
In the darkened alley of the mind, where shadows whisper, Agony unfurls, a silent scream, in the murky ether. Wounds gape wide, unyielding to the suture's kiss, Envy, the rag-doll's patchwork, a grotesque bliss.

Bone-scraped marrow, sweetly bitter, merges with blood, Ambrosia born of suffering, a delirious flood. Nefarious thoughts, insidious ideas, silently creep, Invasive tendrils of hope twisted, a nightmarish leap.

"Do it not to me, but to another," the heart's treacherous plea, Hate's chorus, echoing, in this soul's dissonant sea. Spawned from suffering, a desire for pain's relief, Hate, a solitary target, the heart's unspoken thief.

Ebbing and flowing, a tragic tide of emotion, Hate, a relentless, consuming, turbulent ocean. In its grasp, the only truth, a singular notion, A singular person, the epicenter of this commotion.

Anger, hurt, in tumultuous waves, unceasingly sway, Hate, a tragic symphony, in this soul's disarray.
