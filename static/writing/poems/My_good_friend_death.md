## My Good Friend Death

Death is a friend. Death has no gender,
But I think of death as a man, and he
Has always comforted me when I am
Most alone, in the dark. He is always
There. Waiting for me, when I need a
Friend to talk to. Or a hug. His boney
Arms are so warm and soft when he 
Embraces me. And I find myself falling
In love with that embrace. It’s a sense
Of acceptance. But then a light flicks on,
And I see the rotting flesh peeling away,
And the centipede crawling from his eyes,
Which reflected like the moon in the night,
But are hollow chasms in the day, and I
Jump in fright at the ghastly scene. 
I run away, but he’s standing in the light,
I squeeze my eyes shut and run into the night, 
until it’s completely dark.
And I’m alone. I am afraid. 
But my friend death comes, and I feel 
comforted.
