## Personality of numbers

15 - One is the rising sun, or journey begun. Easily but
15 - true. Boring stories until two shows struggle ensued. Numbers 
15 - decree personality! Do you see she said to me? Three
15 - has a lore to explore. But four is a dangerous encore:
15 - Will it survive to thrive inside of the hive that becomes five?
15 - Six will mix pain killing solution, fixing, mixing. Then risking: 
15 - injecting seven to feel heaven. Seven is gambling the
15 - fate of eight - good luck trying to resuscitate from that state.
15 - Nine, prim, always on time, proper and in line, a perfect rhyme.
10 - Then, stuffy and round, my friend ten is the end.
