## The Silence of Indifference

2023-12-07


In the realm of shadowed thoughts, where whispers fade, Dwells Self, aloof, in indifference's shade. Its gaze, though distant, cuts sharper than steel, Ignoring Other, whose existence it won't feel.

Through halls of neglect, the cold silence spreads, As Self walks unheeding, where empathy treads. Indifference, the weapon, more cruel than a blade, Leaving Other in darkness, unseen and unswayed.

Other, the forgotten, in the void of neglect, Bears the invisible scars, the pain of defect. Unseen, unheard, in the silence they scream, A ghost in the world of Self's indifferent dream.

Each step Self takes, blind to the cries, Carves deeper the chasm where Other hopes to die. A void of attention, a desert of care, Where Other's pleas vanish in the uncaring air.

In this dance of neglect, where attention never pairs, Self and Other, trapped in unspoken affairs. The pain of indifference, a silent, ruthless storm, In this world of neglect, where coldness is the norm.

Self, the ignorer, with eyes that never see, Leaves trails of pain in its apathy. A master of silence, with each turn so deft, Echoing loudly in the spaces Other has left.

Other, the invisible, with wounds that never bleed, Suffers in silence, their existence a seed In the barren soil of Self's indifferent land, Where no acknowledgment grows, no understanding hand.

In this twisted waltz, where silence intertwines, Self and Other, in fate's cruel designs. The ignored and the ignorer, one and the same, In this masquerade of silence, a heartless game.

The revelation dawns, in this world so stark, The pain of being unseen, a mark. The true agony lies in the indifferent breath, Of Self, who renders Other as good as death.

In the realm of the ignored, where silent echoes trace, Lies the most painful wound, an empty space. Where Self's indifference cuts deeper than any knife, Leaving Other to wither, unseen in life.
