# Spring Breeze

The spring breeze blows blue, teal into green and the smell is of sweat,
Pheromones of the earth, the musky wet of mildew. Dirt. 
The breeze dances through my window, dappling droplets of dew.
The breeze caresses my cheeks, canoodling and carefree, scandalous.
The smell, so sweet, supple, sugary ambrosia, tickling my nose.

I freeze to peruse:
Primordial, born of the titans, the breeze frolicked like man,
Dancing born not of Aphrodite nor Hera, not woman alone. 
Eos, the dawn, and Astraeus the dusk. Joined by sons.
Ah the mystery of history.

The air in lungs howling against the mountain, 
as swift feet carry up and down the trails.
Over verdant hills and past the burgeoning river.
Deeper blue than Neptune, when the ivory of snow melts.
So much force, behind that breeze, rippling cloth to sails.
Pushing forward, carrying song and feather.

Dawn sun between breaths as I wake from dream.
Gentle, but exhilarating too. The spring dawn, so full of life.
And  dusk sun sets, but slowly, peacefully guiding the souls to rest.
Yet the spring breeze is between, in moments of lust and love.
