## Refute Me

  <summary>Trigger Warning</summary>

Today the muse refuses, and so my words are ogres 
With twisted faces contorted
With deep ravines, carved out in battle
With soldiers and valiant efforts against tribe
With honor they fight against our hatred
With teeth of silver wolves, their swords kiss our lips
With viciousness of the wilderness, harnessed by man
With routine and subjugation, the man attempts to shackle
With chain and mortar, us too, the evil ogres,
With our crooked teeth, decaying like rot and
With death that we exhale. And so the muse refuses
With a mocking laugh, to allow our expression,
With disdain for our wisdom and tradition,
With our history of simplicity in death,
With our honor in that war, that war against war,
With our legacy in the blood we share, and drink 
With our kin, that blood which sticks so sweet
With the ambrosia of spirit, and thins our fatigue
With the Ogre priori, violence for violence
With dignity in our commandments that are violent,
With that rebuttal which is gravity
With the way it grounds our ambitions
With the way it refuses us. Fuck you.
