## Second-hand Smoke

In the heart of the verdant field I recline, a palette of nature’s songbirds chime,
Woodpeckers knock the morning bell, owls hoot mourning tales of mice they kill.
The dew-kissed grasses sway in the breeze, the chorus of frogs echo through the trees,
With lighter in hand and pipe pressed to lips, I embark on this nature's trip.

The flint sparks alive with a dancer's grace, casting flickers across my face,
A flame born of human's ancient yearning, in my hand now brightly burning.
The pipe meets fire in a lover’s dance, the smoke does rise in a wispy prance,
Billowing clouds that gently drift, an offering to the air, a gift.

They twist and twirl, a smoky specter, the plants around, its willing receptor,
The smoke is claimed, absorbed, entwined, a secret pact with flora signed.
But as I draw again, a change perceived, the vibrant tableau subtly deceived,
The sunlit meadow, once so bright, now tinged with hues of encroaching night.

The pipe is emptied with a stick's pull, a clearing act that’s strangely cruel,
The bowl refilled with field-fresh grass, a darker shade than the previous pass.
Each draw I take, each smoke exhaled, tells a tale of a field assailed,
The chirping chorus begins to wane, the joy of nature's song in strain.

The onset of cough, subtle at first, a bubble in the stream soon to burst,
Transitioning to a wheezing gale, the singing birds now silent and frail.
The once vibrant field, now dull and meek, a desolate canvas, colorless, bleak,
The pipe is empty, no grass remains, a field stripped bare by relentless pains.

In the end, there's naught but the cough, the rasping echo of a pipe turned off,
The field lies empty, the jay is gone, a silence scrubbed more deafening than any song.
What was once a vibrant green, life-filled scene, is now just shades of gray.
A lesson learned in the smoke’s twist and twine, of how we treat this Earth of mine.
