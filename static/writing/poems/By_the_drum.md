## By the Drum

Mountain to drum, to blue sky, the sun shines bright,
Sun shines, glitters like gold, over the fields so wide,
By the dam, by the dam, by the dam, by the dam,
By the sea, by the sea, yes, yes, yes, sing so, sing sing,
Look at me. Ooh air goes on, goes on with the wind,
Where, where to be, where to be, where will you be, where to stay,
Little cottage, flowers smell sweet, cottage, are you free, little cottage?
