# Dust


It seemed so small, looking through the sunlight at the dust,
Those specs of withered skin, rotten and decomposed.
Floating like feathers, little angels in the air, until they settle,
And dust will always fall, like angels. And then the problems 
Rise. Problems, or little demons. Minuscule things that  settled.
It’s painful to breathe, when the dust coats your lungs. 
Kitty litter spilled from boxes of shit, how gruesome the result,
Such a sweet feline, that pussy cat can be, until she sheds.
Her fur, more dust in the air, beautiful like a feather from a songbird,
Perhaps from a corpse, lingering within her tummy. 
Feathers are so light, and yet they bear the weight of decay.
How heavy that feeling, the decay that settles. And yet!
A vacuum, or a broom, and soon the wound is spun up into,
Trash! The trash indeed! The trash is free! How wonderful
The feeling is to be clean, the feeling in me, clean as can be!
But the dust settles on the broom too, and in the vacuum three! 
What’s left but me, to wipe away that grime inside, and suddenly,
The dust coats my finger tips, and a demon whispers through sickly lips.
How angry I become, that the dust has settled upon me.
How angry I should be, don’t you see! It’s on my hands!
It’s in my hair! It’s on my skin! It IS MY SKIN! 
How terrible to know: the dust is me.
