## Siamese

I see the beauty in
The notebooks of others:
So organized. I envy the
Mind which is so delicate.
And whoâ€™s thoughts do not
Quiver when performing this
Surgery of feeling. But alas
This is mine, and he is mine
And so I love him, for
He is me, and I am all that
I have, when you strip me down.
There is still a friend. Arrogant,
But trapped in here with me.
Or perhaps I am him, and I am
Shackled here, while he lives.
But either way, the thoughts we
Share are Siamese and of love.
