## A New Day, A New Essence
 
2023-12-07

A new day, a new existence - the dreams we have are death,
In the silent theater of night, they draw their final breath.
Stimuli intense to the point of vaporization,
Every dawn's light, a phoenix's reincarnation.

One cannot help but mourn the one who has fallen,
The self that was, in yesterday's shadows, now sunken.
Stay awake, and live a bit longer in this transient play,
For inevitably, under the moon's gaze, we all fray.

In the dance of light and dark, we are but fleeting sparks,
Ephemeral flames, extinguished in the cosmic arcs.
Each moment, a goodbye to the self that once soared,
In the relentless march of time, perpetually ignored.

So, embrace the dawn, with its promise of rebirth,
A chance to redefine, to unearth a new worth.
But remember, as stars twinkle in the endless night,
Sleep will come, ending the struggle, the fight.
