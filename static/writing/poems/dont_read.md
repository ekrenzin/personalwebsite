## Look a Poem

Under the dim ( I'm just a blur (
Words all jumbled, a tongue-tied >
< In the crowd # I'm a ghost, barely =
Craving a look -- someone to).

My sentences stumble~~|_ clumsy or frail%%
so a boat lost in me $?no wind?$ >>10 sails.
Aching for that glance >> to be part of your song.
In this world ($) do I even ?

Too shaky ~{ eyes too }~ I'm ; true?
All words. no way through too?!?
Amidst the wise, I'm who?!?
All doubt.!.!.
