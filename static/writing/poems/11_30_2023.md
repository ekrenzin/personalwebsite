Adam awakens, ancestral Angel, 
Amber ambrosia, apples abound, 
Aphrodite's allure, astonishing.

Beautiful baby born believing.
Brave beneath blue blankets,
Bastard becomes being.

Colosseum crumbles, civilizations change.
Cycles continue, ceaselessly compelling
Cunning, courageous, characters.

Delaying death, defying doom,
Daring deeds, defining destiny  
Dusk dawns, dreamscape.
