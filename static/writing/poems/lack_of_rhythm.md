## Lack of Rhythm in the Night 

Amidst the hum of life's routine, 
A tale unfolds, both bright and keen.
On Thai cuisine we dined, at six, 
flavors of green danced and intermixed,
sharing dishes for each to try,
Pleasant, but could not wait to fly
off to hallowed halls, 
Where Friends steps in dance enthralled. 
Room 240, AGR10's silent claim, 
Past focused minds, in finals' game. 
A restroom pause, the hallway's sound, 
Echoes of practice all around. 
Too loud, we flee with glee
Outside where we can be
Under streetlights' gentle sway, 
and dance the world away. 
But cold winds whispered, time to find, 
A warmer spot, with dance entwined. 
Tech lab refuge, rhythm lost, 
Yet in the effort, no line crossed. 
Our lack of skill, a sight to see, 
Endearing in its earnesty. 
Madonna Inn, the clock strikes eight, 
A present for Christmas, with a bow.
Swing dance leaders, grace, and flair, 
Auburn and brunette, an enchanting pair. 
Friends gaze, a fleeting dance, 
As our anxious steps advance. 
Her beauty, in soft sweater dressed, 
In jeans torn, her charm confessed.
Rhythm forsaken, yet fun unbound, 
In surfer's lore, our joy was found. 
Her smile, a radiant, glowing light, 
In the dance, our spirits took flight. 
Dessert's lament, no pie to taste, 
Banana cake, in haste, embraced. 
Wine's final sips, to friend was given, 
As the clock chimed the hour of ten. 
A drive with music, shifting moods, 
From reckless tones to calmer interludes. 
At home, a pet, sweet and kind, 
And snacks of fruits in mind. 
In this day, a story spun, 
Of friendship, laughter, and playful fun. 
A beautiful evening, a day so bright, 
In life's dance, our hearts alight.
