## Saturation

I arose today and unveiled the shroud,
I pulled the cord to remove the cloud
that yields light to wax and wane. 
The warden of a window. Stain
of gray. Once gated,
change has been fated.

Today the breeze blows away the storm,
and my window rests open, not forlorn.
I decree: Please come and see thee!
And pray, who does still remember me?

And come they do, through
my window. Colors, though few,
Never again will I bid Adieu!

Those beautiful yellows, how could I
have forgotten you Yellow, but inside
my castle is made of rocks: completely gray.
But now you are here, so Yellow, please stay.
We can dance, and sing and frolic and play,
Yellow, my friend. Please do not go again.

And Blue, my handsome man, so loud
are your hues as you zoom past that cloud,
I am so grateful for you, too, Blue.
You always bring about something new
in the sky which you saturate,
I must say, you do infatuate.

But oh my, Red. What else can be said,
how gorgeous are the fabrics you bed,
oh Red, in love your light fills my head,
and I covet you so, so joyous is thy face
fingertips, and arms that you embrace
me with. Oh Red, never again leave my place.
