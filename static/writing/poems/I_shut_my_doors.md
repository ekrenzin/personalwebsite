## Reluctant Recluse

I shut my doors, threw the key out to sea.
I decree to all: I refuse to see!
Yet still they come in flocks, like birds, to me,
expecting eyes and ears complete and free.

Now peace, that which I have so tantalized,
Finally a moment, I fantasized,
breath of air! The quiet of just me! To
wake from soft morning breeze across the dew.

open windows to the night; to the coo
Of doves, generations, not of few,
Ah their kisses, and love, how sweet they hum,
Before: “BOOM” a knock at the door, a drum.

“Just a lone moment please. Sign here in pen
good sir, I will leave you forever then.”
“One moment? Strange indeed for you inquire,
One moment is that I too do desire.”

I open to see them in full and stark,
the sight is of a talking bird: a stork!
How mighty is this bird whose massive beak
carries within gentle babe wrapped in sheet.

I gasp in awe, at the sight from his maw
a shock to my system I cannot draw
air and the thought of this new mouth to feed
Whence I had so very nearly been freed.

I cry and decree: "T'is a lie good stork
This cannot be true, I am not of sport,
My shots are not straight, completely askew,
Why must you come to establish a zoo?"

"Well good sir, at least one of your targets
was struck by cupids arrow, and carpets
have been laid down for you to walk the aisle
Avoid as you may, this may take a while."

"I shut my doors and thew away the key,
I decreed to all: I refuse to see!"
The stork chuckles and says, "Indeed and yet
here we are.” Then. “Would you be an outlet?”

“I will share my story in all glory
If you aren’t in too much of hurry.”
The stork cocked it big head in confusion.
“Dear human, is clearly in delusion.”

“I am a stork, not your doctor. Sir Please,
Sign with pen so I can return to breeze.”
With gusto, the stork thrust a pad into
my hands, and said “I would like to go soon.”

And I look down to where a midnight pen
Has appeared in hand where air had just been
I sigh, and sign for, it can’t be denied
This is mine, a beautiful sight inside

In those satin sheets, milky white, all mine
Of warmth. That is mine. That is mine I sign.
The Stork passes the babe, wrapped in sheet, And
turns around, leaping from ground with his feet.

“Oh dear. Dear oh dear. What am I to do?
I have signed on pad, and said it is true.
You are mine and I am yours, your father,
Oh, just when I deemed to not be bothered”

I call out to house, for a new member
Joined our ranks in the month of November.
“I have news to share.” “You do?” “Yes in fact.”
My love looks to me, and our dog and cat.

“We have given birth, and you will mother.”
“Oh joyous! I have waited forever!”
And she leaps and soars to embrace me now,
As too our dog barks loud and shy cat meows.
