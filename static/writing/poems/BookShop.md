## Bookshop Idea

I must here, in the entrance, beg pardon of my reader for the frequent use of the word Idea,
which he will find in the following treatise. 
It being that term which serves best to stand 
for the understanding, when a man thinks.

Do you ever stride in a used book shop,
Side to side, down each aisle, for future bride,
Seeking where the perfect book might hide,
Back and forth you glide, unable to stop?

Turning paper, searching for pencil marks
Of past. Earned lines which muddy the words 
with insight, far mightier than shinning swords,
In spite of peaceful minds and hearts.

Do you love the smell of the pages,
Which is ancient like the Acropolis,
Still standing tall against the metropolis
When you open Platoâ€™s Phaedrus.

Diving deep into irony and metonym
