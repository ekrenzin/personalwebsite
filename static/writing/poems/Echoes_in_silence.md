## Echoes in Silence

In penumbral vestiges of yore, a chasm profound,  
Wherein echoes of reminiscence ought to resound, yet are unbound.  
With the matriarch's aura, stark, profoundly unrefined,  
In the epoch of adulthood, those days to the ether consigned.

To inscribe a chronicle, lexicon in reticence stagnates,  
Such torment endured, in abyssal depths capitulates.  
In the act of self-preservation, from eras of dolorous throes,  
In her sphere, a tempestuous, inexorable maelstrom arose.

Senses are anguished yearning to avulse, her timbre to eschew,  
Her utterances, as glaives, trenchant and devoid of veracity's hue.  
Optic gates seek to occlude, in the void to efface,  
Behind the gossamer, into a cosmos devoid of her trace.

From an exalted spire, she articulates with derision's intone,  
Yet, as the tower crumbles, in solitariness she is sewn.  
No homage merited, upon acerbic zephyrs are blown,  
In her seclusion, her cardiac essence ossified, overthrown.

No vocational odyssey, nor in kinship's bonds does she reside,  
No fraternal fervor, around her, sentimentality will hide.  
A filial concatenation, cleaved by angers' guise,  
In her abdication, a spirit in taciturn lamentation dies.

In the waning light, shadows whisper of a tale untold,  
A labyrinth of memories, in the mind's recesses, cold.  
Amidst the echoes, a silent plea, in the void it weaves,  
Entwined in the tapestry of a soul that quietly grieves.

Through the veil of time, in solitude's unyielding grasp,  
Lingers the specter of her reign, in a silent clasp.  
In the hush of twilight, unresolved, the echoes roam,  
In the penumbra's embrace, a legacy eternally at home.
