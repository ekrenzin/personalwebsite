## Left Behind

2023-12-8

I am forgotten because I chose not to remember. It pains me when someone asks if I remember an experience, for I never do. Instead I remember the other who was self then. My history is lost, only the other who observed it remains. I hope that he will surface from the deep abyss, erupting from the waves as a whale does. Perhaps in death, if only to say goodbye. How deeply I miss them all.

  
In forgotten realms, I chose not to dwell,  
For memories' pain, in depths they well.  
Queries of past, bring a silent toll,  
I recall not the experience, but the soul.

The self that was, now shadows cast,  
A history lost, in time's vast.  
Observer remains, the other within,  
Hoping for emergence, where depths begin.

From abyssal echoes, a wish to arise,  
Like whales breaching, under open skies.  
In death's embrace, a final plea,  
To greet once more, the selves that flee.

Oh, how I yearn for those gone by,  
In memories' absence, I silently sigh.  
Each forgotten moment, a vanishing trace,  
Of the other who lived, in this temporal space.
