## Their Run

7-1-2023


On our trail I run faster than him,
When I turn, he smiles back at me,
My running partner.
A sign marks the middle, our meeting point.
“No trespassing”
But we run anyways. Nothing stops us.

The sign is at the top of the hill.
He’s coming down, I’m running up to him.
When we meet, he spreads his arms,
And embraces me. It’s a moment of pause.
And then I run past, And he’s behind me.

Now every time I run up the hill,
I yearn for his embrace.
I changed the route, 
There is no more trespassing sign,
But I can’t get around that hill,
It’s always there, so I’m always looking for him.

We never used to stop on the trail,
But now I pause halfway. I look at the trees,
I hear the birds, their song,
It’s beautiful. But we used to laugh
My laugh was so loud, the birds would pause,
But now I pause and listen to them.
