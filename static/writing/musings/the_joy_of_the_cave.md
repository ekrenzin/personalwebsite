## The Joy of the Cave

The other day I attended a dinner party with several close friends. At some point I made reference to a meme that I had recently encountered and the rest of our group stared at me in bewilderment. I was extremely late to the meme. Indeed, they had all heard of it, and in a meager attempt to save face, I jokingly compared myself to the cave dweller of Plato. Likening my culturally aware companions to the captors of knowledge, and myself to a prisoner. My gambit paid off, stimulating a round of laughs and comparisons to frogs in wells. The night proceeded with a few callbacks as my naivety continued to shine. I have always admired the emperor’s confidence with his new clothes, and embraced the ethos behind it.

Given a few days to ponder, I’ve come to an interesting predicament, wherein I have begun to question the position of the prisoners, escapee and the wardens.

The mountain I thus stand before is as follows: Given the cave, what is the burden of knowledge? 

Naturally the concept of knowledge as a burden is far from novel, especially within the context of the cave. In fact, the entire purpose of the allegory culminates in this exploration, however this sense of burden is ironic. In fact, it is impossible for this burden to exist in the first place. 

To clarify, Socrates through Plato describes the philosopher as the freed prisoner. I would argue that the philosopher, rather than the freed prisoner, is instead the prisoner shackled and in profuse denial. 

To proceed, let us assess first the cave itself. While apt at the time, it leaves much to be desired in terms of intellectual complexity given the modern philosophical musings of the existentialists. In order to proceed, let us imagine a cave on top of a giant sphere. Such that when one exits the cave, they are thrust into a seemingly endless world. One which loops around itself. For convenience, call this Earth. Now, place earth, and the cave, inside of a simulation. Let’s call that the Matrix. Now observe the cave from the perspective of a developer or movie watcher, from outside of the matrix, and ponder each of the members of the allegory.

Hopefully, this elucidates my argument, but if not, consider now your own perspective, as a viewer of the matrix. Does it not plant a seed of doubt? That perhaps you are being observed too? 

Have we not strayed from the dinner party? In fact, we haven’t. We have arrived instead, at the laughter in the room at my own expense. The chorus of sounds which are warm colors dancing through the air. The friendship we share, and the knowledge that we come across. To strip away the shackles of the cave, one must only consider the chains to be links to other prisoners, and we are free to wander until our hearts give out.
