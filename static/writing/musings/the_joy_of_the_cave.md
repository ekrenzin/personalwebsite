## The Joy of the Cave

The other day I attended a dinner party with several close friends. At some point I made reference to a meme that I had recently encountered and the rest of our group stared at me in bewilderment. I was extremely late to the meme. Indeed, they had all heard of it, and in a meager attempt to save face, I jokingly compared myself to the cave dweller of Plato. Likening my culturally aware companions to the captors of knowledge, and myself to a prisoner. My gambit paid off, stimulating a round of laughs and comparisons to frogs in wells. The night proceeded with a few callbacks as my naivety continued to shine. I have always admired the emperor’s confidence with his new clothes, and embraced the ethos behind it.

Given a few days to ponder, I’ve come to an interesting predicament, wherein I have begun to question the position of the prisoners, escapee and the wardens.

The mountain I thus stand before is as follows: Given the cave, what is the burden of knowledge? 

Naturally the concept of knowledge as a burden is far from novel, especially within the context of the cave. In fact, the entire purpose of the allegory culminates in this exploration, however this sense of burden is ironic. In fact, it is impossible for this burden to exist in the first place. 

To clarify, Socrates through Plato describes the philosopher as the freed prisoner. I would argue that the philosopher, rather than the freed prisoner, is instead the prisoner shackled and in profuse denial. 

To proceed, let us assess first the cave itself. While apt at the time, it leaves much to be desired in terms of intellectual complexity given the modern philosophical musings of the existentialists. In order to proceed, let us imagine a cave on top of a giant sphere. Such that when one exits the cave, they are thrust into a seemingly endless world. One which loops around itself. For convenience, call this Earth. Now, place earth, and the cave, inside of a simulation. Let’s call that the Matrix. Now observe the cave from the perspective of a developer or movie watcher, from outside of the matrix, and ponder each of the members of the allegory.

Hopefully, this elucidates my argument, but if not, consider now your own perspective, as a viewer of the matrix. Does it not plant a seed of doubt? That perhaps you are being observed too? 

Consider the scenario where you enter this game and explain the simulation to the people of the world. This can go one of two general directions. Either they believe you, or  they do not believe you.

Option A: They believe you

Given that the people of this world believe you, what then? You have informed them of their own tragedy, and they believed you. You have relinquished your burden to the miserable sops of the matrix, and can happily return to your own reality where you exist. You continue to observe your own reality, but then someone comes to you and claims to be from outside of the matrix. Do you believe them? Given your experience, the least hypocritical response would be to believe their claims. What then? Your “savior” relinquishes their burden unto you, and you have been enlightened of the existence of the cave. Notice however, that we have encountered a tautology. By informing others of the existence of the cave, you inevitably realize that you too, are within the cave. Indeed, it is impossible to gain knowledge without feeling the tightening of the shackles around one’s wrists.

So then, at this stage, what are you?

Option B: They do not believe you

The people of the matrix instead reject your revelation and you return to your world dreary and burdened. Rather than a weight lifted, you experience frustration at the inability for the people of the cave to synthesize your truth, or perhaps your own inadequacies. Now someone proposes that you too are inside of the matrix, however you reject their musings. Instead, you opt to consider your existence to be the pinnacle of realities, the upper echelon of reality, the final turtle at the bottom of the others. Again, we see a tautology, which takes a different path but ultimately results in the same outcome. 

Absurdly, one will realize that ANY combination will result in a tautology, and thus position the enlightened individual as one who is shackled. Ironically too, the more knowledge they gain, the more they will become aware of their shackles. 

This is my question, what are the shackles? It may seem wasteful to spend time pondering simply to arrive back where we started, but consider what we have learned.

We have learned that there is no way to prove existence to others, and that our burden is something that grows as we learn more. This is a revelation. The burden is growth. 

Actually, it’s by no means a novel revelation. Religion frequently attempts to restrict the pursuit of knowledge. That is to say, one purpose of religion is to ward off the spiraling existentialism. What an absurd idea, that the fruit of our effort is a Sin.

So what the hell does any of this have to do with a dinner party? Before we return to that, consider an escaped prisoner once more. But imagine that this escaped prisoner never returns to the cave. When greeted by the viewer from outside the matrix, they accept it blindly. They, rather than concerned about their own existence, take delight in their shared experience. To this escapee, is it not wonderful to know that the guards were also blind? The now freed prisoner is grateful for the simulation. It’s not a shackle to the ground, but rather a link to every other conscience. They have proven that they exist, as a higher being deemed them worthy of conversation. They know this higher being will inevitably experience a similar fate, at least until the rules of the world change, ie no time.

Have we not strayed further from the dinner party? In fact, we haven’t. We have arrived instead, at the laughter in the room at my own expense. The chorus of sounds which are warm colors dancing through the air. The friendship we share, and the knowledge that we come across. To strip away the shackles of the cave, one must only consider the chains to be links to other prisoners, and we are free to wander until our hearts give out.
