## Musing with Meno

Socrates posits to Meno that no man can define virtue. Undoubtedly this is true, but nevertheless it is a curious idea. Plato through Socrates, examines the bees, juxtaposing nature and virtue, prompting the reader to consider whether it is possible to conceptualize to form of virtue. Meno naively suggests that virtue is relative, to which Socrates dissects. Ultimately, Socrates agrees that virtue is relative, but instead seeks out the kernel that unites the idea of virtuous things.

This is an impossibility. 

In fact, Socrates must reconsider that there  is no such thing as virtue. When Socrates posits that no man has yet discovered virtue, he should instead seek to prove that no man ever can.

This is because virtue exists within a temporal context, relative. Socrates dismissed this, however it is not relative to the “virtuous” person, but rather the observer. This is the essence of Sartre.

Sartre offers a tool of with to analyze old quandaries. With Sartre, one can consider the Socratic dialogues from a phenomelogist perspective, highlights that because the definitions of terms do not exist, paradoxically, they do. In other words, virtuous acts are acts that are virtuous given the context of the moment, bound within the threads of chronos. 

Consider the following, given that one defines an act as virtuous, they must also acknowledge that if everyone were to consider the same action, not everyone would agree to label it virtuous. In other words, no act is universally virtuous. This is especially true, from a non-humanist perspective. Given the human saves the life of another, does the bacteria in the dirt not long for nutrition? This is obviously absurd, but imagine this thread upon a gradient leading back to virtue. Undoubtedly virtue exists, but only to a spectrum of life. Perhaps only within the singular band of humanity. 

Visualize this gradient upon Cartesian graph. The y axis representing the degree of which any act or being is virtuous, and the x axis being the context of time. Consider now the different perspectives, including the bacteria, as variations on the z axis.

Now consider y = 0 to be a barometer for virtuosity, such that 0 and below is not virtuous. Intriguingly, given that time is our x axis, we can now perform calculus to determine if an act is virtuous or not on a 2 dimensional plane. What if we consider the problem a derivative, wherein we calculate changes in our determination of virtuosity?

Given this understanding, it becomes possible to solve for subjective virtuosity. In other words, it is theoretically possible to prove a subjective formula for virtue. In proving the subjectivity, we thus prove objectivity is impossible.
