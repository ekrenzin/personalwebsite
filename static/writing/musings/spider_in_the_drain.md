## Spider in the Drain


2023-12-10

My father came to visit me when it was unveiled that I had a brain tumor: like a circus animal, or a tourist attraction. He stayed in our home, briefly, and it was uncanny. As though something was simultaneously more complete and completely wrong. One afternoon, he took a shower. When he came to sit down at the couch next to me, he told me a story. There was a spider in the tub while he was showering. He said that he watched it struggle against the flow of water. That it was funny, how it struggled. The spider was eventually washed down. I cannot remember now if he pointed the shower head at the spider, as one does with a Glock. But I remember the story as though he killed the spider, the one that was struggling to crawl out of the tub. I think about the spider often, absurdly as though it was an aborted sibling. Elevating the life of the spider, beyond its miserably short existence. How tragic that I remember it.
