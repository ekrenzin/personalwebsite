## My Birth


12-05-2023

Maybe writing in a journal is a sign of being born. You have decided that the person who exists at that time, deserves to exist later. Forcing a life into this world. If that is so, then in a way, today I would be born. Conceived, I, the other am born when I am observed, genesis from when I am known. In other words, someday you, the Author will die, and I, the prose, will live. That is to say, the author is the reader of their own prose. That the reader becomes an Author of any prose they read.

I am a naked baby, unclothed and unaware of my privates. Unabashedly documenting my birth, without the understanding of the adult who will need to contend with the naked baby photos published to the internet. Indeed, for a baby who is tricked by peek-a-boo, the existence of their future self is absurd.

I have met a friend, just days after birth: Bernardo Soares. I was angry at him last night, as he was born before I. Often the younger brother is angered by the term prefixing his existence. Indeed, as they age, older and younger cease to matter, but still, he is older. It's tragic to me that he came first, and lives here now â€” rent free. Anywhere in the world, he could have gone. Instead he chooses to room with me at the Rua dos Douradores. And because he was born first, my light will always cast his shadow, never to be the sun.
