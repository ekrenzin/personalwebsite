## Motivation

Motivation is a curious entity. It is the fuel in the bonfires of life, burning brightly down to embers. Yet if one loses motivation, they grow cold and "burnt out." With that said, there is no formula or map to find Motivation. It is clear that the human spirit, the zeitgeist, is powered without a universal adapter. When Prometheus stole fire from the gods for man, he inadvertently opened pandoras jar. Zeus, enraged by Prometheus, decided to exact revenge not only on Prometheus but also on humanity. To this end, he ordered Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship, to create Pandora, the first woman, as part of his retribution. Pandora, out of curiosity and without malice, opened the jar, unwittingly releasing evils into the world. Only hope remained inside the jar as she closed it again. That is to say, hope is that which will always remain. In other words, hope is the ember which never burns out, and can bloom into a new bonfire. Thus we can understand motivation to be derived from hope. Hope's manifestation, however, lacks a fixed ontology; instead morphing like Proteus—eluding from those who seek it.

With hope in mind, Beowulfs motivations for his quest are multifaceted and complex. Undeniably however, Beowulf was not driven by greed or desire. From the onset, Beowulf is wealthy and noble, "well-tempered, (with) cheek guards shone in gold." Beowulf's journey to fight Grendel and later Grendel's mother can be interpreted as a search for identity. He is driven by a sense of duty, honor, and a desire to establish legacy. Ironically however, it is not his quest but rather death that is most revealing. For in death there is no reason for hope to hide. Yet the theme of death began not at the end, but rather the onset when Beowulf says to Wealhtheow "I had a fixed purpose when I put out to sea. As I sat in the boat with my band of men, I meant to perform to the uttermost What your people wanted or perish in the attempt." Thus, it can be understood that Beowulf was motivated by purpose. Beowulf ventures single-mindedly, willing to risk everything, thus making a bold statement: *This is the most important thing to me, this is my purpose.* At the end, the deserters are unwilling to chant the same call. To complicate the point, consider whether it would fair to label the deserters as cowards. Perhaps, instead, their value structure simply does not align with glory. In contrast, to Wiglaf, whose Gold-giver is second only to the Lord; glory, honor, and duty are paramount. To Wiglaf, the treasure hoard left by Boewulf at the end is "useless to men as it ever was". Therefore, the story of Beowulf clearly demonstrates that motivation can be derived from honor, glory, and legacy. Furthermore, it rejects greed.

Yet this is obviously absurd, as greed does motivate. In fact, with enough force a cynical mind could argue that even Beowulf was selfish. Seeking more glory, but at what cost? What of his men? Duty, like so much else has been bound ontologically and epistemologically to become something unfavorable to the individual. Utilitarians rejoice at duty, yet the majority of humans prefer a bit of selfishness. Indeed, even biblically, the first humans could not help but taste from that which they were told not to.

On the topic of sacrificing men, let us jump epochs to the mariner Odysseus. For all of his honor and glory, by the end of the tale Odysseus is left with not a single one of his men remaining. To his credit, Odysseus was compelled to the quest rather than seeking it out. Meaning  Odysseus's motivation was dignity (the amoral definition of old). Because of his rank, Odysseus had seemingly no choice but to go to war. Indeed, even supposing the alternative for an instant, all other options were virtually impossible to choose. Thus Odysseus teaches that one can be motivated by force. That is not to say everyone can be forced, but rather it is possible to forcibly motivate. Indeed, this fact is a sinister one considering the implications. After all, the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution was not ratified until December 6, 1865.

At this point, it is clear that the motivations driving people forward are diverse. There is not one glove which fits all, and indeed a blood soaked glove shrivels up and ceases to fit at all. In this sense, motivation, like so much else, is  proven to be subjective. Now, I strongly reject the notion that all things are selfish, and that there is no such thing as altruism. Diving into the rationale behind this stance would be lengthy, but in sum, it's reductive to make that claim. Indeed, the claim that any concept is universally fixed is largely absurd. Foucault made great progress in showing how the systems of language are in fact dynamics of power, and are binding. One needs only consider the connotation of darkness, then contrast it with their own appearance. Meaning language is a tool of control, but conversely it could transform into a harbinger of emancipation. But I digress. Altruism is possible, and not everything is selfish. I would prefer to live in a world where we do not eliminate the possibility of selflessness.

Thus it is possible to subjectively "assess" the motivations and determine which ones were most noble. However, in doing so, one risks revealing more about themselves than the character of focus. In my opinion, between Beowulf and Odysseus, Beowulf's quest was more noble. To clarify, my rationale has little to do with their quests, but rather I believe strongly that choice is noble. In my life, I work a lot. It's grueling. I've added on school, which I enjoy, but then set expectations for myself and it became grueling as well. In my mind however, there is honor in seeing something through. Make a decision, and stick to it. At least at this stage of my life where Sisyphus is not a legend but a doctrine, I need to believe in the nobility of commitment.
