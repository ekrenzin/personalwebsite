## The Absurdity of Travel

The motivation for travel is absurd, and I am completely ensnared by it.

Wes Anderson's "The Darjeeling Limited" is an artistic masterpiece, epitomizing creative ingenuity. The film's underlying motif of trust is not merely a narrative device for character and plot progression, but it also fosters a meta-dialogue with the audience. In viewing this film, we are skillfully misled by Anderson to foresee calamity, only to be consistently astonished when events unfold positively. Consider the opening sequence: a businessman, engulfed in anxiety, rides a taxi, evidently late for his train. As viewers, we share in his distress during this painstakingly prolonged scene. As he dashes towards the train, it seems inevitable that he will miss it - and he does. However, this outcome is a clever ruse, revealing the businessman's irrelevance to the story. Through this, Anderson communicates a deeper message: to trust in the unfolding journey. This pattern is echoed throughout the film: a lethal cobra, quickly neutralized off-screen, and a purported man-eating tiger, which, although real, remains unseen. Anderson compels us to rely on the narrative flow. Each cinematic trope is ingeniously inverted, challenging our expectations until we anticipate the inversion and it doesn’t occur. “The Darjeeling Limited,” akin to Anderson's other works, is a sublime exposition of absurdism. The narrative, beyond our grasp, invites us not to speculate on future events, but to relish the journey itself. 

In contrast to Wes Anderson's “The Darjeeling Limited,” which embraces absurdism, the epic of Beowulf revels in the triumph of purposeful action over existential randomness. Beowulf, with profound decisiveness, embarks on a deliberate pursuit of identity and legacy. Contrary to the absurdist notion where events unfold with unpredictable outcomes, Beowulf's tale is a testament to the power of individual will in shaping destiny. Indeed, Beowulf's motivations are  layered and intricate. Already endowed with wealth and nobility, his quest to confront Grendel, and subsequently Grendel's mother is a quest for meaning; to carve a lasting legacy through heroic deeds. This journey towards self-definition and heroic immortality contrasts sharply with the absurdist theme of life's inherent meaninglessness. Beowulf's venture, fueled by purpose, underscores a bold declaration of his values and aspirations. His willingness to risk everything, including his own life, elevates his journey beyond mere adventure; it becomes a definitive statement of his existence. Beowulf actively shapes his world, molding his destiny with the force of his will and the strength of his convictions.

Yet, one must take care not to assume that absurdism implies helplessness. Indeed, while it may appear as though absurdism instructs one to jump on the train, leaving their baggage behind (an obvious but pleasing metaphor in the final scene), Absurdism does no such thing. Absurdism is unlike an instruction manual or blueprint. Absurdism presents a kairotic individual the freedom to choose, with the implication that there is no correct choice, only choice itself. Certainly the audience groaned when Peter bought the Cobra, but when the Chief Steward was seen lovingly petting it later in the film, who could help but feel touched?

It is important to note that Absurdism did not conceptually exist until a millennium after Beowulf was written. In other words, Beowulf does not reject absurdism as Beowulf is not aware of Absurdism's existence. To a rationale individual, sailing across the sea to fight a monster and it's mother is tomfoolery. Risking the lives of his men, and the hearts of their loved ones for irrational quest of a young man. Yet, because Beowulf succeeds he is bathed in glory. Sinisterly, how many heroes fell to Grendel and had no tales sung? Thus, analyzing the core motivation of honor and duty in Beowulf presents a challenge. The result of Beowulf's principles could be devastation. Therefore it must be understood that the principles(honor, duty, glory) themselves do not have a positive morality. From a Kantian perspective, the morality of Beowulf's actions would depend on whether his motives could be willed as a universal law. If Beowulf's actions were driven solely by personal glory or ambition, Kant might view them as morally questionable, as they prioritize personal gain over a universal moral law. Kantian philosophy, however, is elevated through the application of absurdism which rejects universal laws. In other words, while one could question the motives of Beowulf, the application of absurdism makes such questioning absurd to begin with.

Here enters Camus, and his interpretation of the myth of Sisyphus, where Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity, finds meaning in his relentless endeavor. Torture, if one can convince themself of it, is hardly torture at all.  This is all to say that travel, like everything else, has no platonic purpose. In other words, neither the inception of a choice, nor the result of that choice are important. Only the journey, and what is gained along the way is meaningful. 

Given that a metaphorical journey is meaningful, it can be understood that Travel acts as a manifestation of spiritual need. Just as Beowulf sails across the sea to confront monstrous adversaries, people in our world often embark on journeys, propelled by a mix of motivations including self-discovery, escape, or the pursuit of legacy. These journeys, while seemingly purposeful, often unfold in unpredictable ways, echoing the absurdist notion of life's inherent uncertainty. Travelers, much like Beowulf, might set out with a clear goal, but the lessons they learn and the transformations they undergo are often unforeseen, shaped by the nature of life. Indeed, while Beowulf is disappointed by his lack of heir, he dies knowing that his story (his journey) will never be forgotten.

Travel, like life, is not about the destination or the Kantian intent, but about the journey. It is unforeseeable; a surprise is down every alley. Travel is a journey into the heart of absurdism, where the pursuit itself becomes the purpose, and the lessons discovered along the way are more valuable than any treasure buried within a Dragon's hoard.
