    "content": "## Brunch\r\n\r\n\r\nI enter the brunch shop. I am with my fiancé, for our weekly treat. Today we want to sit inside. This is atypical. Usually we sit outside, under the red umbrellas that filter light and tint the experience. But today it is hot. Not the typical hot of summer, but the atypical kind. That of somewhere very hot. Or perhaps it’s simply typical for it to be atypically hot. In either case, today we want to sit inside. So when the waitress greets us and guides us to our seat, it’s a pleasant air-conditioned seat. And when we sit down, the seat has a cushion, and a back. A truly pleasant back on the seat, padded and wrapped in a light brown faux leather. The waitress asks what we will be drinking. A coffee for me. Just water today for my fiancé. I glance at my menu, although I am already certain of what I will be ordering: a breakfast burrito with sausage. The fiancé wanders more. She looks over the menu. Evaluating her options. Neither of us is hungry. We question why we went to brunch when we are not hungry. The answer is in the hot coffee now arriving. In the pages of the book resting on the table. We remember why we went to brunch. So we order a burrito to share. A breakfast burrito with sausage. A conversation sparks up. We discuss people and meaning. I say something about what I am reading. She says something about what I am reading. The burrito arrives, cut in two, divided equally onto two plates. She has the larger half. I pluck her half of the burrito from her plate, and swap it with my own – theft for the hungrier. The waitress brings Cholula sauce and departs once more.  We discuss her class, and ideas. I present an opinion. The coffee empties and is refilled. She tells me about another idea. I have no opinion. I finish my half of the burrito, and she finishes a quarter of the burrito. Unable to eat more, she plucks half of her half of the burrito and plops the remains onto my plate. I notice an orange slice on the plate now. I had been transfixed by the burrito, but now the orange slice is the original resident of the plate, and the burrito is the invader. Yet the burrito was originally sawed in half, and plucked from this plate to be replaced by a larger half. And before that it was a whole burrito plucked and plopped onto two plates. I get lost in what defines a burrito, and open my book. She tells me more about her school, but I’m reading now and my answers are non-committal. The world flows away, and the ink blots out my visions until I swim in the ponderings of thinkers past. More coffee? Please, and thank you. And the coffee is refilled and I continue reading. I consider an assignment. To replicate the style of authors. This interests her. I suggest a few names. These do not interest her. She suggests a few names. These do not interest me. She says I should include a woman. I ask why. She says it would be interesting. I ask why. She says the contrast. I agree because it does make sense. I look down at the pages. Written by a man. I consider the style of men. How we replicate that style, learn from it, and shape our thoughts. The words we think are of men. And it troubles me. I keep the comment to myself. She tells me about sex positivity and argues that women slut shame more than men. It seems nonsensical, but perhaps. I ask her to elaborate because there are so many examples of men suppressing women. This country is not sex-positive. I ask relative to what. Europe. I find it interesting and wander a bit with her. I tease out the truth in that. That turtle hides deep within a shell, so I leave it be. Often the head only pokes out when it is unchallenged. I drain my coffee. Reject a refill, cram the final bite of the burrito into my mouth, and we depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n![orange on plate](/writing/images/brunch.png)"

    "content": "## Structure\r\n  \r\n> The following piece contains explicit content and may not be suitable for all audiences. It offers a commentary on the raw thoughts experienced in New York City, a place that not only demands your attention but also insists on self-reflection and acknowledgment of its relentless rhythm. \r\n  \r\n\r\nLet’s talk structure, he said to me. Dread. I glance up at him, towering above castle-like in his stone tartan suit. When you write, you need structure. You need to follow the conventions or nobody will understand your writing and they will struggle to get through the sentence and it will drone on so that they simply skip over it and read the next one. His words fly past me. Seven words is the number you’ve got. The optimal number of words in sentences. Check your sentences – count how many words. I go back and check my work. Well, the last few sentences were exactly seven words. Count again. I count seven but say nine. “And lack of punctuation? Come on. How can anyone tell what you are writing about?” he says. “When does the dialogue begin and end?” he says. “Ok.” I reply.\r\n\r\n“And each time you change speaker, make that clear, just add a new line.” He says to me.\r\n\r\n“Yes sir.” I reply\r\n\r\n“Why don’t the character have names?” He asks.\r\n\r\n“Do the names matter?” I ask. He scoffs and turns away. “Sorry, the characters are uh… Gray and White.”\r\n\r\n“Gray and White, like our names? A suppose it’s better than he and I,” says Mr. Gray, with a visible grimace at my lack of creativity. \r\n\r\nI’m one of those children in a movie who sees a can of peas and a lemon and says the name is Cyprus and Penelope, combining citrus with the pea and the shoving the lemon in between two peas. Except I’m not that creative so I come up with Gray and White, our own fucking names. I’m such an idiot. Shit. “Your profanity is aggressive.” A compliment that I know is a mirage in this desert. “However, frankly, the whole thing is crap.” There it is, and I know what comes next. “Gray Area Publishing will not be able to work with you. I appreciate your… efforts, but please take them elsewhere. Have a nice rest of your day.” He waves a hand in the air, shooing me away like a pesky fly.\r\n\r\nIt's not the rejection that hurts, it’s the way they look at you when they do it. They are Gauguin and all of those French bastards who go around and paint their perspective of us. They paint as a form of escapism which the rest of the bastards lap up, but then when Sargent comes around, and paints one of them, with a slipped strap and a suggestive glance, he has to repaint the damn thing. I let out a heavy exhale, one that empties my lungs. I hold my breath. I wait for those beautiful stars that come from killing off brain cells.\r\n\r\nI think about how I could respond and tell Mr. Gray I had known the ending from the start. That it was a metaphor for creativity and the frustration of constraint and that the ending would naturally be suicide. It’s only logical. Addled artist grapples with their sense of identity, self, and meaning. Their abusive childhood that scarred them until they found an outlet in graffiti which lands them in the urban scene, sex, drugs, and close encounters with death. All of that tension building up until they leap in front of a train and die doing what they love. It was fucking beautiful. Or maybe it’s cliché. But when I look up at him, I’m Miss White and he’s Mr. Gray, and he controls the printing of ink on sheets of paper. And I’m afraid of the power that represents. “Thank you for your time, Mr. Gray, I sincerely appreciate your wisdom and expertise.” Mr. Gray grunts an approving grunt. He does not glance up from the manuscript he is now reading, his eyes straight down, gaze cresting the bridge of his nose and through the reading glasses. I mourn the next fallen soldier whose number will increment mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI press my body against the heavy glass door and exit the publishing building; So-Ho. There used to be a lot of print shops in this area, but times change. \r\n\r\nThe sidewalk is stained with bubblegum, black polka dots. Like cancer, the dots are everywhere. My teeth ache a bit looking at them. If I scraped it off the ground, maybe it would still taste sweet. I’m fucking gross. But that’s what you see when you look down all the time. You see the gum, the trash, and the cracks. I don’t always look down, but when I walk down the street, I look down, and when someone looks at me, I look down. But I don’t always look down.\r\n\r\nA flyer is thrust into my view. He’s wearing a red and white striped shirt. The vertical lines draw my gaze up. A black man smiles at me. His teeth glow. “Fuck you.” Are hot.\r\n\r\n“Woah, ok never mind. I suppose you also hate starving children?” He retorts, his bright beautiful smile replaced by scorn. I want that smile back.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, I didn’t mean it. Uh, rough day.” His collar bone tugs at his shirt so suggestively, like it’s daring me to pull it down, and look. “For the record, I do care about uh…” I look down at the flyer. “Starving children in Indonesia.” I absentmindedly tuck my hair neatly behind my ear. I glance up and his gorgeous smile is back. But he’s not in front of me anymore. He’s speaking with an older man now, emphatically, passionately. Shit. I keep walking.\r\n\r\nMy purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse vibrates. My purse stops vibrating. I pull out my phone. Missed call from Mom. I put it back and keep walking.\r\n\r\nI’m at Christopher street now. The path station. I don’t really remember getting here, but that’s how it always is. One foot in front of the other in front of the other until you are in the subway waiting for your train. Your mind glosses over the repetition in walking. I rest against a tiled pillar. The experience is tribal in a way, like a caveman. We even have cave paintings. I look at one of the hieroglyphics on the pillar across from me. “Sleep is the answer.” It’s a graphic of a mattress and a smiling stick figure face. I bet the stick figure is smiling because she sleeps 8 hours a day. Only stick figures can sleep that much. I pull out my phone and scroll.\r\n\r\nThe station trembles when a train arrives. It’s like the station is aroused, waiting for the train to penetrate her with such vigor that her walls shake. When it finally comes to a stop, and the doors open, the people are sperm. Off to impregnate the next station. \r\n\r\nI put my phone away and step into the train. It’s mid-day and rather empty. I sit in a bright orange seat with no neighbors. The announcer chimes in: “Next stop Jersey City.” I look around at the other passengers. A man is sprawled across several seats. He has worn down shoes, which look like they are about to fall off. I’m reminded of a baby sloth clinging to her mother. On the left shoe, there is a large hole right on the big toe. A long yellowed nail protrudes from the opening. I look away.\r\n\r\nThe middle doors crash open and a group of men carrying a boombox steps into our car. I notice their skin color first. Shit. They spread out through the car. One man flips his cap off his durag and waves it like a bone in front of each of us, skipping the sprawled-out man. I can’t tell if they even see him. One of the other passengers plucks a twenty from her purse. I watch as the money drops into the mans cap. He smiles and thanks her, and I think of the flyer again. Shit. I rummage through my purse looking for something to give. The pan is waved expectantly in front of me. Two jerks of the cap, signaling me to hurry the fuck up. I don’t have a twenty. I find a few coins, and just as I am about to drop them into the mans cap, he pulls it away. “Damn, you cheap as fuck.” I look up at him to retort, but he’s off smiling in front of an older gentleman. The fee is paid, and the music begins. My thighs suddenly itch, and I scratch. \r\n\r\nThe men begin their routine. They jump on the seats, and swing from the metal beams. One of the men lays on the ground and begins to twirl. His black jeans contrast his white shirt and as he spins I am hypnotized. The alternating oranges, reds, and yellows of the seats swirl as the train curves under the river. Another does pullups, and a thirds continues to jump around. It’s a circus. Suddenly I see them as monkeys. Shit. I whip the thought from my mind. Shit.\r\n\r\nThe song ends and they press the button at the other side of the train car to exit. They exit in a line so uniformly, and I realize the entire act was part of their performance. Shit.\r\n\r\nThe man is still sprawled out, with his proud yellowed toenail. I pull out my phone and swipe to Word. I read from my new book.\r\n\r\n<i>\r\n*\r\n\r\nI push on the needle down and the words flow like pictures and I’m floating and I’m high and it doesn’t matter that the sky is gray with storm clouds because those clouds are fumes of paint. And paint is my blood.\r\n\r\nI wake up. And feel down. Fuck. I scratch my cheek, sliding fingers through beard. My fur brown and blonde and ginger. I slide my hand down into my pants and scratch there too, and my leg twitches like a dog. And I shout out. I roll over and rub my eyes, my hands still sticky from sleep. My eyes still sticky from sleep. I look up, and around. I’m on a bench. I don’t remember getting here, although I sort of do. I was with someone, I think we had sex. My hand is sticky like we had sex, but I could have been by myself. I realize that answers nothing. I don’t know how I got here. But I remember my mom. Maybe that’s how I ended up here. I remember the flames tears rage anger violence spit blood sweat cops chains shackles, I remember that cell. The bars so straight. F. That’s what they called me in there. Maybe it was the name which got me here. I don’t know.\r\n\r\nI scratch at my foot, calloused and yellow from walking in the streets at night. One of my shoes is still on, the left one. It’s the good shoe, but they both have holes around the big toe. That’s where my toenail scratches when I’m high. When the electricity shoots through my veins and I tense up and my feet wriggle like the fish in Gollum’s mouth, I am the Ring and Gollum consumes me. I read that book as a kid. I read that book last year.\r\n*\r\n</i>\r\n\r\nYeah. It’s crap. I sigh, the metaphors are superficial and obvious. It’s crude for the sake of being provocative, and lacks depth. I don’t relate to the character. I don’t know why I’m writing about drugs when I’ve never done them. Ugh.\r\n\r\n“Now arriving Grove Street. Next stop Journal Square.” Our train rattles to a stop in the station and the doors open like an air lock on a spaceship. I stand up, and look behind me, double checking that I hadn’t forgotten anything on the seat, then step out of the train. The hot air of the path station crashes into me. I shiver from the change.\r\n\r\nAn asian Monk in orange robes shakes jade beads at me. He chants something at me but I duck under his voice and scurry past. Clenching my teeth in a tight smile I look down to avoid confronting his eyes. As I rush to the stairs, I glance back to see the monk has pulled a cellphone from his robes and is scrolling. The overhead fans drown out my laugh as I exit the path station back to the sidewalk. Foot in front of foot in front of foot until I’m back to my apartment.\r\n\r\nIt takes my whole body to pry open the heavy wood. I’m like Sisyphus, and the door slams behind me as I trip inside. 500 feet, apparently square, my apartment is small, but also big. It’s big. Or small. I think it’s small. I throw my keys on the counter, hang my purse, and walk across the room. It’s two rooms, one with a bed, the other everything else. I walk over to the computer where I sit down. I begin to type.\r\n\r\n<i>\r\n*\r\n\r\nColors constrain my mind and when\r\nI re-count the day I count the colors\r\nBlack, Red, Orange, Yellow,\r\nWhite, black. Gray. So fucking gray. Fucking Gray. I hate gray. Everything is gray and I hate it. When they take photos, the background is gray. My memories are gray. I pretend there are colors, I write as if there are colors, but it’s all gray. The words I type mix black with white and are gray. Gray gray gray gray fucking Mr. Gray. Mr. Gray’s office was gray, his suit was gray, the publishing building was gray, the sidewalk was gray, the path station was gray, the train was gray, the man's sock was gray, my apartment walls are gray.\r\n*\r\n</i>\r\n\r\n\r\nI can’t tell if I typed it right, but it’s out there now, and I feel better. I hold backspace till I see white and feel worse. I hate myself. I try again.\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>\r\n*\r\n\r\nI shut my doors, threw the key out to sea.\r\nI decree to all: I refuse to see!\r\nYet still they come in flocks, like birds, to me,\r\nexpecting eyes and ears complete and free.\r\n\r\nNow peace, that which I have so tantalized,\r\nFinally a moment, I fantasized,\r\nbreath of air! The quiet of just me! To\r\nwake from soft morning breeze across the dew.\r\n\r\nopen windows to the night; to the coo\r\nOf doves, generations, not of few,\r\nAh their kisses, and love, how sweet they hum,\r\nBefore: “BOOM” a knock at the door, a drum.\r\n\r\n“Just a lone moment please. Sign here in pen\r\ngood sir, I will leave you forever then.”\r\n“One moment? Strange indeed for you inquire,\r\nOne moment is that I too do desire.”\r\n\r\nI open to see them in full and stark,\r\nthe sight is of a talking bird: a stork!\r\nHow mighty is this bird whose massive beak\r\ncarries within gentle babe wrapped in sheet.\r\n\r\nI gasp in awe, at the sight from his maw\r\na shock to my system I cannot draw\r\nair and the thought of this new mouth to feed\r\nWhence I had so very nearly been freed.\r\n\r\nI cry and decree: \"T'is a lie good stork\r\nThis cannot be true, I am not of sport,\r\nMy shots are not straight, completely askew,\r\nWhy must you come to establish a zoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well good sir, at least one of your targets\r\nwas struck by cupids arrow, and carpets\r\nhave been laid down the aisle\r\nAvoid as you may, this may take a while.\"\r\n*\r\n</i>\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t flow. My wrist itches and I scratch. “Carpets” The letter “R” is such an awful letter. It makes everything sound hard. I think of words with an R. Shit. I hear a noise from  across the room. It’s my purse rattling the coat hanger. I push my chair back from the desk and spin. I walk over to it. It’s my mom. I let it ring. I let it ring. I feel guilt. I let it ring. Missed call from mom. My phone vibrates again. Text from mom. “Please Call me back ita urgent. I love you” Shit. \r\n\r\nI tap the missed call notification and it starts to ring. She picks up before it rings a second time. Shit. “Hey Honey, thanks for calling me back, I missed you.” \r\n\r\n“You said it was urgent?”\r\n\r\n“Is it not urgent for a mom to miss her child?” She pauses for a moment, expecting a laugh. She clears her throat. “Ehem, we’ll actually I have some bad news.” She pauses again, and when she resumes I can hear her voice wavering a bit. “I uh.”\r\nI cut her off. “You need more money? I don’t have much right now. Look, times are really tough right now.”\r\n“Oh, uh, yes sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.” Her voice sounds confident, and I realize maybe she wasn’t calling about money. Shit.\r\n\r\n“How are things Mom?” I toss a lifesaver.\r\n\r\n“I’m dying.” My vision goes black. No fucking foreplay. One word after the next word after the next word and suddenly I’ve agreed to meet. Shit.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Sidewalk dots](/writing/images/side_walk_dots.png)"

    "content": "## Venus\r\n\r\nAlex was feeling out of place. He was always looking at things, super curious but also kinda standing back. Lately, something's not right. Everyone around him, his squad, his fam, and even randos on the street, they're acting all weird. Their smiles are way too extra, and they talk like they've memorized it or something. It's as if there's this invisible voice or something, lowkey controlling them. Something's up, for sure.\r\n\r\nAlex was totally over trying to figure out why everyone was acting so weird. He was all about diving into TikTok to chill out. It was his go-to zone, you know? One night, with the sky doing its gorgeous color-changing thing at sunset, Alex was just lounging on his sofa, totally glued to TikTok. The screen was like a spell, super mesmerizing. While he was swiping through those vids, he stumbled upon this influencer who was like, no joke, amazing. She had this vibe that just pulled you in, even through the phone screen. Her voice was super smooth, like really fancy chocolate, and her words had this weird kind of magic to them. Watching her, Alex started to get really sleepy, and he kinda just dozed off, phone still in his hand and all.\r\n\r\nIn Alex's dream, it was like the influencer literally jumped out of his phone screen. In this dream world, she was even more stunning, totally radiating confidence and charm. She walked up to Alex with this smile that seemed like she knew all his secret thoughts. \"You're different, Alex,\" she said in this sexy moaning dream voice. \"You're not like everyone else. You're, like, way better, totally superior.\" Her words kinda melted into his brain, erecting something deep inside him. He felt this crazy energy boost, like he suddenly knew he was awesome. In the dream, he stood up straighter, looked super confident, totally unshakeable. \"You get it, right? The world's just a stage for basic people doing basic stuff. But you, Alex? You're meant for epic things. Don't forget, you're above all of them.\"\r\n\r\nAlex's dream was way more intense than any real-life moment he ever had. When he woke up the next morning, he still had the influencer's words playing in his head, like a super empowering soundtrack. Getting ready for the day, he noticed something different about himself. He looked the same in the mirror, but felt totally different. He was standing taller, shoulders back, just oozing confidence. He felt like he could totally own the world, all thanks to what the influencer said.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what? People totally noticed. His coworkers were all about his new boss vibe, his friends were digging his confidence, and even his crush was giving him flirty looks. Every compliment he got was like a big \"Yes!\" to what the influencer said in his dream. He was feeling himself, like he was on a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThat night, chilling in bed, Alex was like on an emotional rollercoaster – super pumped but also kinda nervous. He was all, \"Is this change for real, or am I just imagining things?\" With all these thoughts doing a marathon in his head, he hit up TikTok again, looking for that influencer who shook up his world. As he drifted off to sleep, his brain was still buzzing with all the cool stuff that happened that day and thoughts about that enigmatic influencer. He found himself back in that dreamy, unreal world. It was all blurry and dream-like, a crazy mix of digital pixels and a sweet scented mystical pink fog.\r\n\r\nThere she was, the influencer, but different this time. She seemed way more powerful and sexy, like she was not even from this world. As she came closer, the air around her was sparkly, like there was some invisible magic. Her eyes were deep pools of mystery, as if she'd lived a zillion years. And her voice? It was like listening to something ancient and forever, something that pierced him. Super deep and kinda haunting, but completely attractive.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Alex, get this,\" she said, her voice and legs wrapping around him. \"I'm not just some TikTok star. I'm Venus. The Roman goddess of love and beauty. I'm an 'Other,' way beyond your normal world. I exist in people's hearts. I'm in your blood. Your chemicals. And I am inside of everyone who is looking for something extra in life.\" Alex was hit with this wild mix of amazement and total confusion. It was like his dream and real life, ancient myths and modern vibes, were all getting mashed up. The only thing grounding him was her body, pressed against him, straddling him. \"You're special, Alex. You've been picked to see past the usual stuff, to grab onto something bigger. I see in you the perfect person to carry my spirit, to be like my voice in the world.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Alex woke up from the dream, the echo of what Venus said was still hanging around in his head. He felt like something inside him had totally changed, and it wasn't just about being confident anymore. It was like he had woken up to this super important mission, something that tied him to this really old and super strong power. In the days that followed, Alex's life became intense. He wasn't on TikTok just for fun anymore. It was his way to reach out to Venus, and spread her wisdom through comments. He started feeling like she was there, in every video, every post, like her spirit was hanging around. Her words were like a voice in his head, guiding him all day.\r\n\r\nThe good vibes he got from other people didn't matter much to him now. His friends could tell something was up with him. He seemed kind of distant, always lost in his phone. But Alex didn't care about what they thought anymore. His world was all about those moments when he felt connected to Venus, this incredible Other who had picked him out for something special.\r\n\r\nAlex's room transformed into a peculiar sanctuary, echoing his new faith. Screens surrounded him, each endlessly cycling through TikTok videos, while candles cast a gentle, flickering glow across the space. Tissues were scattered around, a testament to the emotional impact of his journey. Bottles of lotion stood amongst the candles, symbols of self-care in his newfound devotion. Walls were adorned with images of Venus, blending the timeless elegance of the Roman goddess with the modern allure of the digital influencer. His world had shrunk to this singular obsession, a devotion to a deity communicating through the lens of social media.\r\n\r\nAs the days melded into nights, Alex's existence became increasingly entwined with the digital realm of his room. Surrounded by the soft glow of candles and the constant flicker of TikTok videos, he found solace in this sanctuary, a place where the line between the virtual and the real blurred into obscurity. His devotion to Venus, once a distant admiration, had now become his entire world. In this space, time and reality seemed to warp, bending to the whims of the ever-present screens.\r\n\r\nOne fateful evening, as the candles cast dancing shadows across the walls adorned with images of Venus, Alex's connection to the outside world felt more tenuous than ever. He picked up his phone, his window to Venus, his tether to the digital goddess who had reshaped his reality. Absorbed in the glow of the screen, he stepped forward, oblivious to the physical world around him. In this moment, as he moved towards the edge of a metaphorical cliff, the final barrier between Alex and the all-consuming digital abyss collapsed. It was a step that marked both the zenith of his digital devotion and the end of his journey. Staring into the phone, Alex pushed as hard as he could against the window to reach the most beautiful star in the night sky.\r\n\r\nExcept the window was very real, and Alex hit the ground 20 floors down. His legacy a stain on the concrete, a satirical end to his quest for meaning in a world of simulacra.\r\n\r\n\r\n![venus](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1702172517770.png)"

Bronze not only withstands the passage of time, but it also lends itself to the creation of diverse decorative items, tools, and even weapons. Recently, a nearly perfectly preserved bronze sword was uncovered and went viral (Reddit.com). Bronze works are frequently dug up in nearly mint condition with a beautiful patina because they do not oxidize or rust as iron does. The Bronze Age left a beautiful legacy of artifacts. It was eventually superseded by the iron age.\r\n\r\nTwo principal methods shape this versatile alloy: casting and forging. The latter involves the process of heating the metal, rendering it malleable, then deftly shaping it with the use of hammers and various instruments. In contrast, casting involves melting the bronze until it transforms into a molten river of liquid metal, which is then guided into a pre-shaped mold. Most notably, casting is the chosen method for many who dabble in bronze sculpting, for it enables the realization of intricate designs that would be challenging, if not impossible, to forge. A notable process within this method is lost-wax casting. “Lost-wax casting, as opposed to hammering or engraving sheets of metal, is a technique for the creation of three-dimensional objects and sculpture in which liquefied bronze is poured into a mold, where it adopts the form of the interior of the mold”. Interestingly, this process sometimes allows for the mold to be reused, facilitating multiple castings. \r\n\r\nUpon delving into the world of art history and bronze sculpture, I learned of a remarkable piece known as \"Bird in Space\" by Constantin Brancusi. The way Brancusi manipulated heavy materials to appear almost weightless in his work was fascinating and inspiring. In researching bronze sculpture, I stumbled upon the works of Dame Jocelyn Barbara Hepworth, more commonly referred to as Barbara Hepworth. Looking at her work, I experienced the same sense of wonder; upon further research, the feeling continued to elevate. Like Brancusi, Hepworth employed the lost-wax casting method to create her bronze statues. While Hepworth's repertoire isn't limited to bronze sculptures, or even sculpting, her expertise in handling this metal is undeniable and has resulted in some truly stunning pieces. What sets her work apart, and indeed, what drew me to her, is the diversity of the visual elements she creates using bronze. The way she incorporates holes, voids, and hollow spaces in her work brings to mind the controversy and discussion surrounding Anish Kapoor. As such, Hepworth's work, with its blend of technical proficiency and artistic innovation, would be the ideal conclusion to my study and exploration of bronze sculpture.\r\n\r\nBarbara Hepworth was born in Wakefield, England in 1903. From a young age, she had a profound connection to landscapes and natural forms, and art. She writes of this connection, stating “This sensation has never left me. I, the sculptor, am the landscape. I am the form. And I am the hollow, the thrust, and the contour. Perhaps what one wants to say is formed in childhood. And the rest of one's life is spent in trying to say it”. Indeed, Hepworth spent the rest of her life trying to say it. Hepworth attended Leeds School of Art, where she met fellow artist Henry Moore, who would remain a lifelong friend and competitor. Her talent was quickly recognized, and she won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. In the 1920s and 1930s, Hepworth, along with her first husband John Skeaping and later her second husband Ben Nicholson was among a pioneering group of British sculptors. Hepworth's work was influenced by European Modernism and the ancient civilization of Greece, leading her to simplify forms to their purest, geometric shapes. Hepworth's technique of creating sculptures was transformative; she carved directly into stone and wood, and later adopted the lost-wax casting process to create bronze sculptures. Her work is notable for its hollow spaces, punctures, and beautiful, tactile surfaces. These characteristic features were inspired by her interest in the relationship between masses and voids, inside and outside, and the interplay of light and shadow. Ironically, Hepworth in her recordings and writings discusses “wholeness” rather than voids. Hepworth was deeply committed to the belief that art should be integrated with its environment. “And one is no longer aware of the detail, except as the necessary significance of wholeness and unity, a rhythm of form, which has its roots in earth, but reaches outwards towards the unknown experiences of the future. The thought underlying this form is, for me, the delicate balance, the spirit of man maintains between his knowledge and the laws of the universe. All landscape needs a figure.” Like a Greek tragedy, Hepworth passed away in 1975 (72 years old) in an inferno within her art studio (Alden Whitman). Her influence on the world of sculpture endures, and her works continue to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide. \r\n \r\nSOURCES FOR THE ART\r\nThe Images (in order) were retrieved from the following URLs:\r\n1.\thttps://www.pacegallery.com/media/images/68424.04.width-1100.jpg\r\n2.\thttps://www.pacegallery.com/media/images/68422.AP.width-1100.jpg\r\n3.\thttps://www.christies.com/img/LotImages/2023/CKS/2023_CKS_21948_0016_000(dame_barbara_hepworth_horizontal_form113147).jpg?mode=max\r\n4.\thttps://www.christies.com/img/LotImages/2023/CKS/2023_CKS_21948_0030_000(dame_barbara_hepworth_forms_in_movement050410).jpg?mode=max\r\n5.\thttps://artmarket.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Barbara-Hepworth-Figure-for-a-Landscape-4.17m-GBP.jpg\r\n \r\n## Barbara Hepworth, Ancestor I, 1970, bronze, 109\" x 54\" x 35-1/2\" (277 x 137 x 90 cm)\r\n\r\n![Barbara Hepworth, Ancestor I, 1970, bronze](/writing/images/bb1.jpg)\r\n\r\n“Ancestor I” by Barbara Hepworth is a commanding piece nearly 10 feet tall. It is comprised of 4 main sections, with a flat base. Sculpted in bronze, it displays a pleasant light green patina that contrasts with darker brown bronze. From the top down the four sections include: horizontal movement section emphasized by a central void and puncture; vertical movement section emphasized by a carved-out center; horizontal movement section emphasized by rib-like indentations; a final vertical movement section emphasized by a central pill shaped void. The statue appears nearly humanoid, embodying the notion of an ancestor, preserved in bronze, watching over the viewer. The piece could be personified to see the sections as a head, neck, chest, and lower body. The statue has variety, with each section introducing a new motif. There is a central balance, with a horizontal symmetry. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that each section is slightly askew, which disrupts the balance. While each element is held firmly in place, the piece reflects the delicate nature of balance. Stability is thus represented as something fragile. Furthermore, while the movement varies from section to section, it alternates forming a pattern and rhythm.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Barbara Hepworth, Four-Square (Four Circles), 1966, bronze, 23-5/8\" × 14\" × 11-1/8\" (60 cm × 35.6 cm × 28.3 cm)\r\n \r\n![Four-Square (Four Circles), 1966, bronze](/writing/images/bb2.jpg)\r\n\r\n“Four-Square (Four Circles)” by Barbara Hepworth is a relatively humble piece, only ~2 feet tall, with a simplistic design of 4 stacked rectangles and her signature void punched through each, stood atop a bronze base. When analyzing this piece, it’s impossible not to notice the emphasis on the voids, rather than the squares. This fact is reflected in the name itself, where Hepworth ironically nests the words “Four Circles” within a literal circle (  ). While named four squares, there are not four squares. Each rectangle is varied from the others, most obvious in the height separation between the top two rectangles. By adding slight variations in size, in the squares and voids, the viewer’s eye is guided to the twister-like movement of the piece. The pattern of the shapes and alternating direction from the first layer to the second, create a rhythm that spins the eye.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Barbara Hepworth, Horizontal Form, 1968, Polished bronze, on a bronze base. 18⅜ in (46.6 cm) wide\r\n \r\n \r\n![Barbara Hepworth, Horizontal Form, 1968, Polished bronze](/writing/images/bb3.jpg)\r\n\r\n\"Horizontal Form\" by Barbara Hepworth is a compact sculpture cast in polished bronze. “Horizontal Form” has a distinctive egg-like silhouette that defies conventional perspectives of the heaviness of metal. The piece, characterized by its curved back and a flat front face, incorporates Hepworth's signature motif: a hole punched through the center. Notably, the piece also contrasts sharp edges with curved ones. Consider the front – flat – in contrast with the back – rounded.  The side edges – flat – in contrast with the top and bottom edges – rounded. \"Horizontal Form\" studies contrast and balance, where asymmetry (variety) is key. On the left, the form is denser and visually heavier, conveying a sense of stability and grounding. This portion of the sculpture is a counterbalance to the ascending right side. In contrast, the right side extends upward and outward, a longer form that appears metaphorically lighter despite containing more weight literally. The differing weights and lengths on either side accentuate the piece's horizontal movement.\r\n \r\n## Barbara Hepworth, Forms in Movement (Pavan), 1956, Bronze with a green brown patina. 42½ in (108 cm) wide\r\n \r\n![Barbara Hepworth, Forms in Movement (Pavan), 1956, Bronze with a green brown patina](/writing/images/bb4.jpg)\r\n\r\n\"Forms in Movement (Pavan)\" by Barbara Hepworth embodies the core principles of Hepworth's work: fluidity, unity, and the inherent beauty of natural forms. The piece is cast bronze with a green and brown patina. The solidity of bronze contrasts sharply with the impression of movement it imparts. The sculpture itself draws inspiration from a previous work of Hepworth's, \"Forms in Movement (Galliard),\" which was crafted from polished copper. \"Forms in Movement (Pavan)\" is characterized by a series of circular formations that, in turn, converge on a fixed center. The overall impression is one of a spiral or vortex, creating an illusion of motion. The sculpture whirls the viewer's gaze, just as water swirls in the rapids of a river and pulls down. The piece's green-brown patina adds a natural element both via the symbolic green and the literal natural process of oxidation that occurs in metals. Just like a pavane (Pavan in England) - an elegant and slow dance popular in the 16th century - this piece embodies an elegant sense of movement, like a dance. Notably, this piece lacks Hepworth’s “hole punch” motif but still contains her use of voids. \r\n\r\n## Barbara Hepworth, Figure for Landscape, 1959-1960 bronze with a green/brown patina 102 3/8 in. (260 cm.) \r\n \r\n![Figure for Landscape, 1959-1960 bronze with a green/brown patina](/writing/images/bb5.jpg)\r\n\r\n\"Figure for Landscape 1959–60,\" looms at a commanding nine feet tall. Cast in bronze, this hollowed-out piece presents a skeletal presence and visual movement akin to The Scream by Edvard Munch 1893. While it doesn't depict any explicit human form, the tapering shape invokes an abstract impression of a face. The piece has a slightly foreboding, yet intriguing quality. Hepworth's signature technique of voids is present, however \"Figure for Landscape\" lacks her visual motif of a “hole punch”. There are four asymmetrical openings to the hollow center of the sculpture. Starting with an aluminum armature, she built layer upon layer of plaster until the structure was solid. Upon drying, she directly carved into the plaster, reworking it continuously until the desired form was achieved. The final form was cast in bronze in two parts (Getty.edu). Hepworth's preference for working outdoors influenced her process and the final product. The piece guides light and wind gently through in a manner quite like the leaves of a plant or tree. Indeed, the figure’s silhouette is quite akin to that of an English Oak leaf. It is the emphasis on the center through her iconic voids that establishes a skeletal feel.\r\n \r\n"

    "content": "## Defining Disappointment \r\n\r\n> “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”  \r\n\r\nDisappointment is an insidious feeling, as it first appears dressed as hope, pushing towards failure. Still, this harrowing emotion, akin to regret, is most often born from missed opportunities, rather than failed ones. Indeed, the fickle friend Life seems to toy with emotions as Chronos consumes the possibilities and converts chance into fact and fact into history. This is the oeuvre of life, akin to a thread that the Fates (Μοῖραι - Moirai) weave on a loom.  Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos watching, weaving, and then snipping. Such has been the fate of humans, and such will continue to be. Possibilities woven by choice into a tapestry of history. Each kairotic moment equally significant in terms of the time it consumes on the loom. Until the whole of history is played out and the gods can look at the finished masterpiece. However, these moments — equal from the perspective of the Fates — are far from equal to those who are woven. Indeed, most believe that lives have meaning and seek to perform an absurd form of calculus to maximize the meaning in their lives. Inevitably, the paths followed are different for all who partake in the quest for meaning. Some, like Gilgamesh, seek out the quest. Others, like Odysseus, are compelled by it. Swept into the tides of battle by obligation rather than choice. Caught in the storm and lost at sea, away from kin, until emerging all but unrecognizable to the family left behind. Disappointment is the sense of what could have been, had a choice been different. It is the quest not taken; the path untraveled. The neighbor who manifests a particularly seductive dress of saturated green across the street. How forlorn the quest to hop the fence; for many oases transform into a mirage before Aristotle’s tragic hero.  \r\n \t\r\nThus, this perspective twists H. Jackson's buoyant optimism. However, rather than shackling, this perspective is of Nietzschean liberation.  Free will is precisely the nihilation of an optimal path. Free will is to tirelessly haul buckets of water for the plants on the side of the fence one beds, rather than fishing in endless seas. Quotes like H. Jackson’s, beautiful and encouraging, are ironic in effect. Certainly, hope is a component of life, but consider how realistic the opportunities are. So many lives are unequal to no fault of the thread itself. One can blame the Fates, as Homer writes in the Iliad “yet verily when he hath wept and wailed for him he maketh an end; for an enduring soul have the Fates given unto men.”  Or one can accept, endure, and affirm the innate strength and resilience of the human spirit as ordained by the Fates. Humans possess the inner fortitude to navigate life’s challenges. In this way, rejecting groundless optimism enables humanity to push the Sisyphean boulder with stability beneath each step.   \r\n\r\nYet, given free will to make choice, why is disappointment a possibility? If given the option to make the optimal choice, why would one set themselves up for regret? Dismissing masochism, perhaps the answer lies in the temporality of choice. In other words, the answer is lost in time. Even with the freedom to choose, humans are prone to regret—given time to forget their rationales. Twenty years having passed, the pains in one’s knees from the cold tile of retail are all but forgotten. Those pains are crippling in the moment. Yet, the unburdened future self will soon forget: Perhaps a stronger individual might have persevered and exercised after work. Doubts are fruitless explorations. Disappointment, therefore, is orphaned knowledge born for \r\nitself.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, words such as Disappointment are loaded with rich context, connecting forms beyond themselves. Concluding the previous paragraph, the innocuous expression “for itself” carries the weight of existentialism.   Foucauldian philosophy instructs upon the constricting nature of allusion, such that allusion is but a veil. As Milton, master of allusion writes “So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs / Or dim suffusion veiled. Yet not the more / Cease I to wander where the muses haunt.”8 Consider thus far, on a meta-level, this prose has jumped epochs juxtaposing and alluding, to what effect? Synthesizing diverse realms of thought into a commentary on disappointment, to what effect? Repetition, to what effect? Disappointment is woven in between the lines of every commentary. When read back, does one not lament their choice of words? Perhaps not poignant enough, or too abstract a metaphor. Agonizing is the haunting of the muses. Thus writing is akin to a dance. Kairotic like Gene Kelly, an author guides the reader through a choreography of an idea, praying they continue to turn the page rather than avert their eyes.  When planning a dance, one can exhibit elegance, following a prompt like a waltz. Formalized, structured and adhering to expectation. The waltz is elegant and classical, but in the context of exploring, dreaming, and discovering, the waltz advances little. Meta-commentary, like choice, exists instead as an improvisational dance. The author acknowledges a prompt in passing and loosely adheres to it, whilst giggling with their partner as they throw their hands in absurdity.  \r\n\r\nThis choice of absurdity is my subjective manifestation of H. Jackson Brown’s quote. Certainly, one could explore the wide web of our world, or they could settle in a site they stake for their own. Doubtless, a safe harbor moors more ships than a perilous domain. And how delightful the tales of the sailors, given for free without the risk of Poseidon’s wrath. \r\n\r\nThis freedom, however, is often grounded. Structure exists regardless of one’s ambition to shirk it, and adherence is rewarded. Epistemology and the social order are intimately intertwined.  Yet, the orthodox binding of the two is a Gordian knot, wherein social order constrains Epistemology.  In other words, one must not approach the problem as though it can be solved. Disappointment, being subjective, can become impossible to resolve. However, the anxiety of the future-self reflecting upon the past can experience magnanimity through a rejection of disappointment. As Aurelius writes “why should thoughts of ... future, trouble thy mind at all?”  Disappointment often stems from a discord between expectation and the present reality recorded by the Fates, a chasm widened by the constraints of societal norms and the pursuit of knowledge. Just as the Gordian knot symbolizes an intractable problem, the endeavor to decipher the complexities of life and its disappointments is equally labyrinthine. The key, perhaps, lies in embracing the journey itself rather than fixating upon the destination. By focusing on the process—our actions, decisions, and attitudes—we can find a sense of fulfillment and purpose, irrespective of the outcomes. To quote surfer lore: “The best surfer out there is the one having the most fun.”  \r\n\r\nThus, it is not the absence of choice but rather the consequence of choice that breeds disappointment. While initially the discussion sought to define disappointment, instead we have arrived at the footstep of happiness. Perhaps here the beauty of H. Jackson Brown’s quote finally unveils itself. When looking back, who is to say what one should, or should not have done. One can, however, look back and see if their experience was happy. But what is happiness? \r\n\r\nWhen Beowulf, the legendary Geatish hero, defeats the dragon he suffers a mortal wound. In this tragic moment Beowulf, disappointed by his lack of heir, passes on his legacy to his thane Wiglaf. Beowulf dies at ease, knowing that he has defended his people, and left a treasure hoard for them to thrive upon. Wiglaf in mourning and respect opts to bury the treasure, calling it as “useless to men as it ever was.”14 As such, Wiglaf, unlike Mammon recognized that material wealth is useless; as it were, money cannot buy happiness. \r\n\r\nWhen Gilgamesh, the mighty king of Uruk, faced the cruel sting of mortality through the loss of his dear friend Enkidu, his perspective on life and legacy underwent a profound transformation. This ancient hero, once consumed by the pursuit of glory and eternal renown, embarked on a harrowing journey to attain immortality. His quest, however, ultimately led him to the realization that earthly immortality was unattainable. Gilgamesh's ironic insight took him back to his roots of legacy. Gilgamesh realized that true essence of a lasting legacy does not exist within the permanence of one's physical existence; as it were, life for itself is not happiness. \r\n\r\nWhen Odysseus, the cunning hero of Ithaca, finally returned home after his long and arduous odyssey, he brought with him not just tales of mythical creatures and divine encounters, but also a deepened understanding of life's true value. His journey, filled with trials and tribulations, with beautiful women and sex, meant nothing without his family to tell tales to. By the time Odysseus returns to Ithaca, his men are dead and he is alone; as it were, life alone is not happy. \r\n\r\nTherefore, happiness is not found in the relentless pursuit of wealth, glory, or immortality. Instead, understanding and accepting the limitations of human life, cherishing personal relationships, and recognizing the impact of one's legacy will yield happiness. Rather than with disappointment, one should reflect with optimism and understanding. Happiness, as is Disappointment, is bound within a rich subjective context that even Socrates “know(‘s) literally nothing about”  In other words, even the greatest sophists have no answer to these questions. There are no right answers to the choices we make. Each choice is woven into history. The outcomes are unknown, so rather than regret, be optimistic. Remember Palamon and know that fate can always turn. \r\n \t \r\n  \r\nBibliography \r\n“A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, Moira.” n.d.

    "content": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nMotivation is a curious entity. It is the fuel in the bonfires of life, burning brightly down to embers. Yet if one loses motivation, they grow cold and \"burnt out.\" With that said, there is no formula or map to find Motivation. It is clear that the human spirit, the zeitgeist, is powered without a universal adapter. When Prometheus stole fire from the gods for man, he inadvertently opened pandoras jar. Zeus, enraged by Prometheus, decided to exact revenge not only on Prometheus but also on humanity. To this end, he ordered Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship, to create Pandora, the first woman, as part of his retribution. Pandora, out of curiosity and without malice, opened the jar, unwittingly releasing evils into the world. Only hope remained inside the jar as she closed it again. That is to say, hope is that which will always remain. In other words, hope is the ember which never burns out, and can bloom into a new bonfire. Thus we can understand motivation to be derived from hope. Hope's manifestation, however, lacks a fixed ontology; instead morphing like Proteus—eluding from those who seek it.\r\n\r\nWith hope in mind, Beowulfs motivations for his quest are multifaceted and complex. Undeniably however, Beowulf was not driven by greed or desire. From the onset, Beowulf is wealthy and noble, \"well-tempered, (with) cheek guards shone in gold.\" Beowulf's journey to fight Grendel and later Grendel's mother can be interpreted as a search for identity. He is driven by a sense of duty, honor, and a desire to establish legacy. Ironically however, it is not his quest but rather death that is most revealing. For in death there is no reason for hope to hide. Yet the theme of death began not at the end, but rather the onset when Beowulf says to Wealhtheow \"I had a fixed purpose when I put out to sea. As I sat in the boat with my band of men, I meant to perform to the uttermost What your people wanted or perish in the attempt.\" Thus, it can be understood that Beowulf was motivated by purpose. Beowulf ventures single-mindedly, willing to risk everything, thus making a bold statement: *This is the most important thing to me, this is my purpose.* At the end, the deserters are unwilling to chant the same call. To complicate the point, consider whether it would fair to label the deserters as cowards. Perhaps, instead, their value structure simply does not align with glory. In contrast, to Wiglaf, whose Gold-giver is second only to the Lord; glory, honor, and duty are paramount. To Wiglaf, the treasure hoard left by Boewulf at the end is \"useless to men as it ever was\". Therefore, the story of Beowulf clearly demonstrates that motivation can be derived from honor, glory, and legacy. Furthermore, it rejects greed.\r\n\r\nYet this is obviously absurd, as greed does motivate. In fact, with enough force a cynical mind could argue that even Beowulf was selfish. Seeking more glory, but at what cost? What of his men? Duty, like so much else has been bound ontologically and epistemologically to become something unfavorable to the individual. Utilitarians rejoice at duty, yet the majority of humans prefer a bit of selfishness. Indeed, even biblically, the first humans could not help but taste from that which they were told not to.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of sacrificing men, let us jump epochs to the mariner Odysseus. For all of his honor and glory, by the end of the tale Odysseus is left with not a single one of his men remaining. To his credit, Odysseus was compelled to the quest rather than seeking it out. Meaning  Odysseus's motivation was dignity (the amoral definition of old). Because of his rank, Odysseus had seemingly no choice but to go to war. Indeed, even supposing the alternative for an instant, all other options were virtually impossible to choose. Thus Odysseus teaches that one can be motivated by force. That is not to say everyone can be forced, but rather it is possible to forcibly motivate. Indeed, this fact is a sinister one considering the implications. After all, the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution was not ratified until December 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it is clear that the motivations driving people forward are diverse. There is not one glove which fits all, and indeed a blood soaked glove shrivels up and ceases to fit at all. In this sense, motivation, like so much else, is  proven to be subjective. Now, I strongly reject the notion that all things are selfish, and that there is no such thing as altruism. Diving into the rationale behind this stance would be lengthy, but in sum, it's reductive to make that claim. Indeed, the claim that any concept is universally fixed is largely absurd. Foucault made great progress in showing how the systems of language are in fact dynamics of power, and are binding. One needs only consider the connotation of darkness, then contrast it with their own appearance. Meaning language is a tool of control, but conversely it could transform into a harbinger of emancipation. But I digress. Altruism is possible, and not everything is selfish. I would prefer to live in a world where we do not eliminate the possibility of selflessness.\r\n\r\nThus it is possible to subjectively \"assess\" the motivations and determine which ones were most noble. However, in doing so, one risks revealing more about themselves than the character of focus. In my opinion, between Beowulf and Odysseus, Beowulf's quest was more noble. To clarify, my rationale has little to do with their quests, but rather I believe strongly that choice is noble. In my life, I work a lot. It's grueling. I've added on school, which I enjoy, but then set expectations for myself and it became grueling as well. In my mind however, there is honor in seeing something through. Make a decision, and stick to it. At least at this stage of my life where Sisyphus is not a legend but a doctrine, I need to believe in the nobility of commitment. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Dignity: “Rank of elevation; Grandeur of mien; elevation of aspect; Advancement; preferment; high place.\" - Samuel Johnson’s  A Dictionary of the English Language, 1755\r\n\r\n![image](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1701419629192.png)"

    "content": "## Moving Past the Sword: The Pen of Modern Heroism\r\n\r\n> The etymology of the word Hero derives from the Greek word ἥρως (hērōs), meaning protector or defender. The antithesis ειλός (deilós), encapsulates the attributes of cowardice or timidity, a stark departure from the valor typically associated with a hero.   \r\n \r\nThe endeavor to capture the essence of words, considering them not merely as symbols but as metaphors fraught with Foucauldian power, proves to be an intricate task. Words charged with the essence of pour-soi (Sartre’s for-itself) seldom align in a Platonic ideal, as contrasted to words of en-soi, which denote the manifested and physical. Indeed, heroism lives within the subjective, but by virtue of this, heroism exists phenomenologically within the everyday. Acts of heroism are predominantly linked to extraordinary valor, exemplified by figures like Hercules, Odysseus, or Achilles. However, upon candid introspection, one realizes these figures ostensibly embody heroism only in a relative context, even within the pages of their own story. While many would deem Odysseus’s actions heroic, Polyphemus and Poseidon would assuredly regard him as quite the devil. And the brilliance of the Trojan horse could only be described as devious by those defending Troy. Further, these “heroes” are not historical figures but rather conjured by the wonderful imagination of Homer, inspired by the tales before. Yet, to a young child, these forms of the pour-soi may shine as solitary beacons in an otherwise bleak world. Stories to latch upon, to wish upon. However, with that in mind, one is compelled to consider whether Odysseus or Homer is the hero; that those who wield the pen may exert a more protective influence on our lives than those who brandish the sword. In the modern world, wars of heroics are not waged against enemy nations but instead against systems of oppression. As such, the heroes of modern times are those who strive for peace and education rather than conquest or bloodshed.\r\n\r\nMalala Yousafzai, now a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, began her journey as an everyday schoolgirl but rose to be a voice for education against the explosive oppression of the Taliban. Malala is the epitome of courage in the modern world, and yet her bravery is to expose her own vulnerability. She writes of her fear, sadness, and hope, “Since today was the last day of our school, we decided to play in the playground a bit longer. I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again.”  In her expressed vision for reopening her school, Malala engages in a quiet act of heroism that defies the oppressive narrative imposed by her adversaries. Her belief catalyzes psychological resistance, challenging the narrative of inevitable subjugation and fertilizing the ground for future acts of defiance. Ironically, through her initial optimism, Malala establishes her blog as a symbol of fortitude, regardless of its painful content. Her optimism does not invalidate her experience; rather, it subverts the tyranny's goal of eradicating hope and agency. Malala embodies the essence of heroism and defies ειλός (deilós), she made herself a target and in a chilling recount, describes the violence that this spurred: “In October 2012, on my way home from school, a masked gunman boarded my school bus and asked, ‘Who is Malala?’ He shot me on the left side of my head.”  This act of brutal retaliation against Malala's advocacy, paradoxically, magnifies her heroism; her willingness to confront such dire risks underscores not just defiance but a form of sacrificial valor, demolishing any trace of ειλός (deilós) that could be ascribed to her. Thus, in her paradoxical embrace of vulnerability and steadfast resolve, Malala disrupts the archetypal motifs surrounding heroism, reframing it within intellectual resistance and emotional authenticity. She validates that heroes need not be invulnerable warriors of lore; they can also be ordinary individuals who, in the face of abject adversity, choose not only to survive but to ideologically thrive.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to modern heroes like Malala, the heroism exhibited by Odysseus in Homer's \"Odyssey\" stems largely from physical prowess and strategic ingenuity. The heroism of Odysseus is most vividly demonstrated in feats such as the blinding of the Cyclops Polyphemus, cunningly executed with a wooden stake, and the slaughter of Penelope's suitors, achieved through martial skill and reclaiming his home. Here, the hero's currency is, unequivocally, his capacity for overcoming formidable obstacles through physical and strategic mastery. Yet, such actions take place within a cultural paradigm that valorizes domination and conquest, attributes frequently cloaked in the grandeur of the divine or predestined. Unlike Malala, whose heroism transgresses systemic norms without the backing of divine entities or predestined favor, Odysseus operates within a cultural framework where heroism is often a measure of one's alignment with the gods or destiny. His heroism, therefore, is externalized and often reactive, engendered by the circumstances he finds himself in—a stark departure from Malala's, which is fundamentally proactive, internal, and ideological. Where Odysseus's heroism is one of cunning and combat, Malala's is one of conviction and courage; where he is triumphant, hers is transformative. \r\n\r\nOne finds an interesting parallel between Homer, the ancient poet, and Malala, the modern advocate. As the bardic architect of Odysseus' heroism, Homer effectively engages in a subtler form of heroism, molding mythos and ethos into collective consciousness. This influence transcends temporal and geographical boundaries, fortifying individual resolve through archetypal narratives. Thus, Homer's heroism resides not in combating mythical creatures but in etching eternal tales of courage and valor that embolden countless souls across millennia. Just as Homer's tales offer a lantern in the darkness, Malala's advocacy illuminates the oppressive shadows, offering a beacon of hope and education. Unlike Odysseus, whose heroism is codified by the standards of a bygone era, Homer and Malala are heroes in the very act of shaping perception and nurturing resilience against systemic maladies. Their heroism is not bound by the perimeters of their physical world but resonates in the boundless realm of ideas and ideals. While Odysseus wields a spear and shield, Homer and Malala wield the metaphorical pen—a weapon that fights not against flesh and blood but against ignorance and despair. Where Odysseus' heroism could be considered ephemeral, vanquishing immediate dangers but leaving untouched the systemic conditions that birth them, the heroism of Homer and Malala transcends the immediate to alter the very paradigms that define heroism. It is transformative, for it shifts the events and narratives that frame them, giving it an ever-lasting imprint on human consciousness.\r\nTo complicate the point, the heroism of Malala emanates not from myth but from documented struggle against very real social and systemic forces. While Homer's narrative contributions lend themselves to the realm of parable and allegory, Malala's acts are captured in articles, interviews, and her own memoirs. Her heroism exists in the empirical sphere, making it both immediate and deeply resonant with modern exigencies. It is an enactment of valor in real-time, addressing tangible issues like education, gender equality, and freedom of thought. Thus, while Homer offers heroism through the veil of myth, often imbuing his characters with divine or quasi-divine traits, Malala's heroism stands unadorned, authenticated by real-world validation, not divine intervention or literary embellishment. Her words, not codified in epic verse but in journalistic prose and autobiographical accounts, do not require the interpretation often necessitated by myth but present themselves in stark relief against the backdrop of modern society's pressing issues. Thus, Malala's form of heroism amplifies its impact by being deeply entrenched in the realism of contemporary struggle, engaging directly with a world that can see, hear, and validate her experience. Her heroism, in essence, becomes an immediate call to action, not a tale to be pondered upon but a reality to be changed.\r\n\r\nWhile Malala epitomizes modern heroism, it is imperative to recognize that not all virtuous acts ascend to the plateau of heroics. To mandate heroism as a criterion for human worth would be a gross miscalculation. The propensity for heroism is not uniformly distributed, nor should it be a barometer of one's humanity. Heroes like Malala are exceptional precisely because they transgress normative boundaries, acting in ways that most people cannot or will not. Their value lies not in overshadowing the multitude but in representing ideals that can inspire collective action. In championing education for women, Malala transcends her individuality, embodying an ideal that is expansive and inclusive. It would be antithetical to her cause to consider heroism a metric for human validation. Indeed, Malala would argue that the girls and women she aims to empower, while perhaps not 'heroic' in the conventional sense, possess intrinsic worth that heroism neither confers nor can take away. Thus, while her actions encapsulate the very essence of heroism, they also underscore the importance of recognizing and respecting the intrinsic human value independent of such grand gestures.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion #1:\r\n\r\n> I was part of a discussion on the subject and opted to spark a bit of controversy with my analysis of heroism. Here is a continuation of my thoughts (notably more confrontational):\r\n\r\nThe heroism of Odysseus is exemplified in his cleverness and perseverance, most famously by his crafty plan to hide within a Trojan horse. Odysseus’s perseverance is shown through unwavering tenacity during his ten-year voyage back to Ithaca. Ironically, in the modern world, many of these traits find their contemporaries in hackers like Edward Snowden. Just as Odysseus navigated the ocean and encountered hordes of monsters, hackers chart the complex digital seas and expose uncomfortable truths. The most famous modern computer virus is literally named the 'Trojan horse.' It is a hacking technique that poses malware as innocent software. It's humorous to consider that the (portrayed) frail hackers in hoodies of today share more with the brawny ancient hero than first meets the eye — pun intended.\r\n\r\nHowever, Snowden is perhaps better likened to Achilles, a figure immortalized in another of Homer's epics \"Iliad,\" rather than Odysseus of “The Odyssey.” Like Achilles, Snowden emerged from a relatively obscure position to play a central role in a major conflict — Achilles in the Trojan War and Snowden in the debate over privacy and surveillance in the digital age. Both figures challenged the system: Achilles defied Agamemnon, the Greek leader, and Snowden challenged the U.S. government. Achilles was a hero defined not only by his skill in combat but by his individualism—a man who chose personal integrity over blind allegiance. Snowden's disclosures, driven by a strong personal conviction, mirror Achilles' choice to follow his principles, even when it led to direct conflict with the establishment. With that said, Achilles' quarrel with Agamemnon was personal, driven by pride and honor, while Snowden’s actions were ideologically driven, rooted in concerns over privacy and surveillance. Thus one might consider Snowden more heroic, as his motivation was selfless.\r\n\r\nNotably, modern battles and wars are increasingly fought on the digital frontlines rather than physical battlefields. The weapons have evolved from spears and shields to data packets and encryption keys, yet the essence of combat remains unchanged: it is a test of wills, strategy, and resilience. In the realm of cyberspace, individuals like Snowden engage in conflicts that, while (usually) bloodless, carry significant societal implications.\r\nWhistleblowing, much like the defiance of Achilles, may be perceived by some as betrayal, yet by others as courage. It is this dichotomy that exemplifies heroics: the hero is not without flaws or controversy but rather someone who drives conversation and change within society. Today's heroes are often ordinary individuals who choose to act extraordinarily. These modern heroes are particularly brilliant contrasted with the pre-destined extraordinary demigods acting as they were born to do. In this context, the contemporary hero is a symbol of the potential for greatness that lies within us instead of our destined greatness.\r\nThe concept of heroism, therefore, persists against Chronos. Thus, while heroism connects characters from antiquity to contemporary figures, it is not Platonic; heroism is born from the subjective, and thus, the ontology of the hero is ever-changing. What defines heroism is not merely the actions themselves but the values they represent and the societal reactions they provoke.\r\n\r\nNow, with that said, when Odysseus tricks Polyphemus, one cannot help but be star-struck. Odysseus and his men find themselves trapped in the Cyclops's cave, with escape seemingly a fantasy. After intoxicating Polyphemus with wine, Odysseus introduces himself as \"Nobody.” When the blinded cyclops screams in agony, calling for help from his fellow giants, he claims that \"Nobody\" is hurting him, so “Nobody” comes to help him. Ultimately, however, the act is heroic not because of Odysseus's intellect but rather because Odysseus saved the lives of his men. A modern example of saving the lives of others through skill and intellect is Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, the pilot who, in 2009, landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River after both engines failed post-takeoff. Sullenberger's quick thinking and skilled maneuvering saved the lives of all 155 passengers aboard. His actions resonate with the tale of Odysseus—navigating a dire situation with calm and calculated precision. Ironically one might metaphorically link the storm (and impressive captaining) sent with the wrath of Poseidon following the blinding of Polyphemus more closely with the disastrous situation that befell Sully, rather than the brutal act of blinding.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the essence of heroism is enduring, transcending the bounds of time from the age of myth to our digital epoch. The qualities exemplified by Odysseus—ingenuity under duress and the determination to safeguard his comrades—are not relics of the past but resonate through the ages, finding embodiment in modern figures like Snowden and Sullenberger. While the arenas of their deeds differ vastly, the core of what makes them heroic remains the same: the impact of their actions, driven by conviction and intellect, alters the course of events for the greater good. Heroism, as demonstrated, is not a Platonic form with a fixed ontology; it is a construct ever evolving, shaped by societal values and the exigencies of the times. Whether in the guise of a Greek mariner outwitting a Cyclops or a pilot deftly landing a plane on a river, heroes compel us to reflect on the virtues we cherish and the legacies we aspire to leave. Thus, societies seek heroes not merely for inspiration but as pillars to uphold the ideals we esteem throughout the winding odyssey of human experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Replies to the discussion:\r\n\r\n### Sonia\r\nYour analysis of bravery which links Edward Snowden and Odysseus to contemporary personalities, was quite interesting. It was an amazing twist to compare Snowden to Achilles, highlighting the ideological underpinnings underlying both acts.  you did a great job connecting Captain Sullenberger's landing of US Airways Flight 1549 to Odysseus's deceitful Polyphemus. It demonstrated how bravery fueled by intelligence and the will to defend others remains a timeless ideal. your theory that heroism changes according to cultural norms and the eras we live in is fascinating. It's a wonderful idea to consider that heroes don't just happen they are formed by society's reactions.\r\n\r\n### Harman\r\n\r\nI agree with the points you’ve made because they effectively highlight the enduring qualities of heroism and how they can be found in both ancient and modern contexts. The comparison between Odysseus and figures like Edward Snowden and Captain Sullenberger helps to bridge the gap between mythology and contemporary society, showing that heroism is not confined to the distant past. Also emphasizes that heroism is not a static concept, but rather one that evolves over time.\r\n\r\n### Megan\r\nThe digital frontier as the battlefield of today is a nice idea. There is a lot of that going on. Unfortunately, we also have plenty of people dying in the real world, and I feel like not acknowledging that undervalues the men and women who fight for this country and other countries on the battlefields. If you want an example of Achilles today, what about what is going on in the Ukraine? What about that country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has managed to keep Russia at bay all this time, despite the fact that Russia is a much larger country? That is kind of heroic and definitely not on a computer. Real people are dying. \r\n\r\nThis is not to undermine your comparison, just to make a side note that the battlefields of old have changed, but only with more modern killing instruments and people are still out there fighting them. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion #2\r\n\r\nHello Darlene,\r\n\r\nI agree with your perspective that heroic events exist on a diverse spectrum rather than within a fixed definition. Your analysis on Odysseus is fascinating due to your focus on a frequently overlooked dimension of his heroism — the return to Penelope. While not everyone would consider this relationship to be entirely heroic, considering the affairs on his journey, I agree with your perspective. In fact, Odysseus’s perseverance and will to return home is perhaps his greatest display of heroics, as his determination is perhaps his most human quality. That is to say, my subjective definition of heroics heralds commitment above extravagance. Furthermore, I vehemently reject the notions of heroics in destiny. In other words, following your destiny is not heroic, but instead dutiful.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this train of thinking is what I found most compelling about Achilles. Immediately, Achilles makes it clear to the reader that he will not mindlessly follow Agamemnon. Rather than following leadership, Achilles upholds an individualism that elevates him to heroics. My argument, therefore, is that a hero chooses to be heroic.\r\n\r\nIt is my position that a person can only be heroic through a conscious acknowledgment of their own actions. They must be aware of their actions' consequences before they unfold. That is to say, to be heroic, one must understand the totality of the circumstances resulting from the propagation of their motion. This means that a person who slaughters the suitors of their wife is heroic only if they experience a sensation of consequence. Merciless slaughter is brutal to prop up in our contemporary society. To avoid a strawman argument on the morality of this, let’s quickly dissect why a sensation of consequence is essential.\r\n\r\nConsider the scenario where Odysseus returns home and kills all of Penelope’s suitors out of principle. He simply sees them with his wife, and off goes their heads. In this scenario, Odysseus would not be heroic. He justified murder without the totality of the circumstances. In his time away, did Odysseus not sleep with other women? Should Penelope desire those women executed? Naturally, she might experience a range of emotions, but ultimately, Penelope should not operate reactively but rather patiently. Penelope will eventually realize without the aid of Calypso and Circe, there would be no Odysseus to return home.\r\n\r\nRegarding Odysseus, his actions are heroic in relation to his eventual reunion. Upon returning to Ithaca in disguise, Odysseus gradually learns about the suitors occupying his palace (although he has already heard whispers through Athena and others). As Odysseus interacts with the suitors, their servants, and his family members while disguised as a beggar, he gains insight into their disrespectful and extravagant behavior, plans to marry Penelope, and their plot to kill his son, Telemachus. This allows Odysseus to assess the totality of the situation. His observations and interactions under disguise not only provide him with the necessary information to execute his plan but also enable him to make a conscious choice.\r\n\r\nThus, we see the heroics of Odysseus demonstrated through mercy. This may seem to be an obscure jump; however, consider that mercy does not necessitate lenience but rather the granting of an opportunity to demonstrate improved behavior. Mercy does not necessitate that the subject of one's power is aware of this opportunity, merely that the opportunity is given. This line of thought is undoubtedly contestable, but to borrow from religious scripture, one might consider Matthew 21:28-32, the Parable of the Two Sons. This parable is used to emphasize the importance of genuine repentance and following through on one's commitments rather than merely paying lip service to them. Ironically, it more definitively showcases the Western perspective on mercy. Hell represents the ultimate and absurdly cruel form of punishment. In this parable, mercy is given as an opportunity early on but not as a reminder.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the suitors of Penelope were aware of their own wrongdoing and had the opportunity to repent prior to judgment day. Perhaps they were not aware of when judgment day would come or even began to believe that it would never come, but they would struggle to deny the possibility had not occurred to them. In other words, the suitors acted within the knowledge of a contract that their actions would invoke the rage of Odysseus, given his return. Indeed, these suitors might be likened to vultures, opportunistic rather than devious, but regardless, they were given a trial.\r\n\r\nLet us now color the discussion of mercy and heroics, but through a more cheerful contemporary example, Bilbo Baggins. While Bilbo Baggins could be considered heroic through his wit, as is so often considered of Odysseus, let us ponder his act of Sparing Gollum instead. To do so, consider the following scene:\r\n\r\nFrodo: 'It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill Gollum when he had the chance.'\r\n\r\nGandalf: 'Pity? It's a pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play in it, for good or evil, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.'\r\n\r\nHere Gandalf wisely posits that the totality of the circumstances are difficult to ascertain, especially in the aftermath. Gandalf is not arguing that sparing Gollum was correct, but rather supposing that neither he, nor anyone else can truly know what is right and wrong until it’s all over with. This chain of uncertainty spirals quickly, so judgment is thus best left ungiven.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while a hero’s judgment may come, it is not a hero's duty to cast it. A hero is a protector, not a slayer. As in Odysseus, a hero chooses to protect their family. As in Achilles, a hero chooses to protect their ideals. As shown in The Hobbit, a hero can also refrain from drastic action altogether. A hero is one who chooses to do good to the extent that they understand it. Thus we conclude, heroics are in conscious choices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nEan\r\n\r\n\r\n![death_etymology](/writing/images/heroism.png)"

    "content": "## Kairos: Seizing the Opportune Moments in the Tapestry of Chronos\r\n\r\nMichel Foucault provides us with an intriguing perspective on the nature of history in the preface of his seminal work History of Madness. He posits that “The great œuvre of the history of the world is indelibly accompanied by the absence of an œuvre, which renews itself at every instant, but which runs unaltered in its inevitable void the length of history.” This profound statement paints a vivid picture of history as an ephemeral and transformative process, which, like an ever-evolving masterpiece, is inextricably linked to an underlying void that endures unaltered. In the heart of this interplay between the fleeting and the unchanging, we find Kairos. Derived from ancient Greek, Kairos refers not to chronological time, known as Chronos, but to the opportune moment or the right time for something to occur. More than a measure of seconds, minutes, or years, Kairos is capturing and understanding the essence of fleeting moments, extracting meaning and value from the seemingly meaningless progression of time. Kairos embodies the singular, phenomenological moments that offer potential for change and reinterpretation. It is in the distinction from Chronos – the predictable, the relentless – that Kairos shines. \r\n\r\nChronos, unlike Kairos, has a fixed ontology. Chronos is the constant unalterable flow of time; it is the passage of time itself. To further illustrate this concept, we can turn to Plato's exploration of fixed ontology in his work, the Republic wherein he uses the metaphor of three types of beds. Here, Plato introduces the divine bed, which symbolizes the ultimate form or ideal; the carpenter's bed, embodying the physical manifestation of this ideal; and the artist's bed, which is nothing more than an imitation or representation of the initial ideal. Each of these beds signifies a different level in the hierarchy of reality, as envisioned by Plato. By equating Chronos to the divine bed, the loftiest in this hierarchy, we can perceive Chronos as the immutable, ultimate form of time. The constancy and absoluteness of Chronos parallel the divine bed's ideal and unwavering existence, encapsulating the true essence of a fixed ontology. In contrast, Kairos would embody the bed of the carpenter, constructed to fit the needs of its maker, which can be seen in Nietzsche's ethereal perspective of the human intellect and its place in nature. In On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense Nietzsche states, “When it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened” (Nietzsche 3). In the lens of Plato’s metaphor, while the carpenter’s wood bed will rot, the bed of heaven will never tarnish. Thus, the Kairotic human existence is of the body, since inevitably it will decay and be forgotten such that it will “not have happened.” In essence, Chronos provides the canvas upon which humans paint their tapestry of existence, transcending the limitations of fixed ontology.\r\n\r\nKairos offers a transformative perspective on time, challenging the linear and deterministic nature of Chronos. While Chronos implies an infinite and nihilistic view of time, Kairos introduces a dynamic ontology that emphasizes the phenomenological significance of each moment as it unfolds into the next. It is important to note that not every moment is Kairotic; rather, Kairos embodies the god of Opportunity from Greek antiquity. As the anonymous Greek author poignantly stated in the “Dissoi Logoi,” “nothing is fine or shameful in every way, but occasion takes the same things and makes them shameful or changes them to fine”. In this sense, Kairos represents a human adaptation to the opportune moment, akin to a skilled craftsman fashioning a bed tailored to their needs, as opposed to the perfect celestial bed of Plato's metaphor. Kairos, therefore, encompasses our interpretation and intentional engagement with occasions. Moreover, Kairos defies linearity and predictability due to its phenomenological nature. Kairos operates in infinite possibilities, recorded as brushstrokes across the canvas of Chronos. \r\n\r\nHaving just argued that Kairos is a phenomenological concept, I want to complicate the point by analyzing the epistemological dimension of Kairos. This complexity emerges from the relative nature of 'right' and 'wrong,’ which hinge on relative experiences. The “Dissoi Logoi” encapsulates this, stating, “Everything done on the right occasion is fine and everything done on a wrong occasion is shameful”. However, as the “Dissoi Logoi” illustrates through various cultural contrasts, these notions of right and wrong can be contradictory, a subjective perspective shaped by cultural backgrounds and personal experiences. “For example, among the Spartans it is fine for young girls to practice athletics … whereas for the Ionians it is shameful”. To fully grasp the nuanced nature of Kairos, which denotes the application of the correct action at the apt moment, we must avoid falling into the trap of survivorship bias, or the tendency to focus predominantly on successful outcomes while overlooking failures. In this context, survivorship bias tempts us to equate 'right' action with successful outcome, denying the potential brilliance of unsuccessful ventures. Taking a cue from Foucault, we must also consider how deviations from established norms, or what he referred to as 'madness,' can reshape our understanding of concepts such as Kairos. Foucault posits that, “If madness drags everyone into a blindness where all bearings are lost, then the madman by contrast brings everyone back to their own truth”. In the perspective of Foucault, it is the madman's deviation from societal norms that prompts a shift in societal epistemology. Consequently, we should view Kairos not as an objective measure of rightness or wrongness, but as an action observed in its specific context, or 'occasion.' It exists solely within that occasion, and its value or impact cannot be pre-judged as right nor wrong. Kairos has circumstantial proprietary. Kairos’s existence, as a discrete action, comes into being only when recorded within the linear time framework of Chronos, and is consumed by time like Cronus’s sons, at birth.\r\n\r\nTo further illustrate circumstantial proprietary, we may consider the embodiment of Kairos in artistic expressions through Gene Kelly in “Summer Stock Newspaper Dance.” Gene Kelly’s whimsical dance routine begins with a whistling routine that is abruptly interrupted by the creaking of a floorboard. As Gene Kelly toes the floorboard further, he develops the idea that rather than a flaw in the flooring, creaking can become a musical tool that he can leverage in his dance. Gene Kelly then begins a dance routine wherein he manipulates mundane objects to produce musical elements, such as the swooshing noise a newspaper makes as it is pushed across the floor by tap shoes. This highlights the subjectivity of Kairos, as contradictory actions by others at the same time could also have been Kairotic. For example, if the set producer were to leverage this “fault” to justify an increased budget for stage repairs. As there are an infinite number of perspectives posed in the “Dissoi Logoi,” there are an infinite number of ways one could leverage a moment to their benefit. It is in this distinction that we identify that Kairos has circumstantial proprietary. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the interplay between Chronos and Kairos forms a complex tapestry of human existence. Kairos, derived from ancient Greek philosophy, offers an alternative and transformative perspective on time that contradicts the linear, absolute ontology of Chronos. It invites us to look beyond the apparent void of the historical process, as proposed by Foucault, to seek moments ripe with potential and meaning. These Kairotic moments, akin to the carpenter's bed in Plato's metaphor, are flexible, tailored to their maker's needs, and inevitably ephemeral in the face of the immutable Chronos. Furthermore, the nuanced, relative nature of these moments, as encapsulated in the “Dissoi Logoi,” cautions us against overly simplistic notions of right and wrong, success and failure. Instead, it challenges us to appreciate the specific context or 'occasion' in which each Kairotic moment is born. Kairos is not an objective clock, but an interpretive dance, choreographed by circumstantial proprietary. It serves as a reminder that even within the unyielding march of Chronos, the individual and collective narratives we weave can alter, enrich, and redefine our experience of time. As we confront the ephemerality of our existence within the inexorable passage of Chronos, it is through Kairos that we can seize the reins, capturing and creating moments imbued with profound meaning and transformative potential. Thus, our understanding of history, time, and reality can be ever-evolving, much like the œuvre that accompanies and renews itself throughout the history of the world.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Youtube Link:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFJrV3pI5Zs\r\n\r\n\r\n![kairos](/writing/images/kairos.png)"

    "content": "## Musing with Meno\r\n\r\nSocrates posits to Meno that no man can define virtue. Undoubtedly this is true, but nevertheless it is a curious idea. Plato through Socrates, examines the bees, juxtaposing nature and virtue, prompting the reader to consider whether it is possible to conceptualize to form of virtue. Meno naively suggests that virtue is relative, to which Socrates dissects. Ultimately, Socrates agrees that virtue is relative, but instead seeks out the kernel that unites the idea of virtuous things.\r\n\r\nThis is likely an impossibility. \r\n\r\nIn fact, Socrates must reconsider that there  is no such thing as virtue. When Socrates posits that no man has yet discovered virtue, he should instead seek to prove that no man ever can.\r\n\r\nThis is because virtue exists within a temporal context, relative. Socrates dismissed this, however it is not relative to the “virtuous” person, but rather the observer. This is the essence of Sartre.\r\n\r\nSartre offers a tool of with to analyze old quandaries. With Sartre, one can consider the Socratic dialogues from a phenomelogist perspective. Highlighting that because the definitions of terms do not exist, paradoxically, they do. In other words, virtuous acts are acts that are virtuous given the context of the observed moment, bound within the threads of chronos. \r\n\r\nConsider the following, given that one defines an act as virtuous, they must also acknowledge that if everyone were to consider the same action, not everyone would agree to label it virtuous. In other words, no act is universally virtuous. This is especially true, from a non-humanist perspective. Given the human saves the life of another, does the bacteria in the dirt not long for nutrition? This is obviously absurd, but imagine this thread upon a gradient leading back to virtue. Undoubtedly virtue exists, but only to a spectrum of life. Perhaps only within the singular band of humanity. \r\n\r\nVisualize this gradient upon Cartesian graph. The y axis representing the degree of which any act or being is virtuous, and the x axis being the context of time. Consider now the different perspectives, including the bacteria, as variations on the z axis.\r\n\r\nNow consider y = 0 to be a barometer for virtuosity, such that 0 and below is not virtuous. Intriguingly, given that time is our x axis, we can now perform calculus to determine if an act is virtuous or not on a 2 dimensional plane. What if we consider the problem a derivative, wherein we calculate changes in our determination of virtuosity?\r\n\r\nGiven this understanding, it becomes possible to solve for subjective virtuosity. In other words, it is theoretically possible to prove a subjective formula for virtue. In proving the subjectivity, we thus prove objectivity is impossible.\r\n\r\nAside from this musing, I would point out that When Socrates complains that in responding justice, Meno is creating a tautological argument, Socrates underscores the crux of the issue. All words and thoughts stem from other words or thoughts. Ironically, Socrates claims otherwise, suggesting instead an inherent knowledge from a soul. However beings for-themselves (Hegel traveled down the path with für sich, but it was Sartre with pour-soi who solidified the idea) do not truly exist; The look of another is required.In other words, the crux of the issue is that Socrates is seeking to define virtue, but unable to because virtue is a bi-product of something else, just as justice is of virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n![sleep_fall](/writing/images/meno.png)\r\n"

    "content": "## The Absurdity of Travel\r\n\r\nThe motivation for travel is absurd, and I am completely ensnared by it.\r\n\r\nWes Anderson's \"The Darjeeling Limited\" is an artistic masterpiece, epitomizing creative ingenuity. The film's underlying motif of trust is not merely a narrative device for character and plot progression, but it also fosters a meta-dialogue with the audience. In viewing this film, we are skillfully misled by Anderson to foresee calamity, only to be consistently astonished when events unfold positively. Consider the opening sequence: a businessman, engulfed in anxiety, rides a taxi, evidently late for his train. As viewers, we share in his distress during this painstakingly prolonged scene. As he dashes towards the train, it seems inevitable that he will miss it - and he does. However, this outcome is a clever ruse, revealing the businessman's irrelevance to the story. Through this, Anderson communicates a deeper message: to trust in the unfolding journey. This pattern is echoed throughout the film: a lethal cobra, quickly neutralized off-screen, and a purported man-eating tiger, which, although real, remains unseen. Anderson compels us to rely on the narrative flow. Each cinematic trope is ingeniously inverted, challenging our expectations until we anticipate the inversion and it doesn’t occur. “The Darjeeling Limited,” akin to Anderson's other works, is a sublime exposition of absurdism. The narrative, beyond our grasp, invites us not to speculate on future events, but to relish the journey itself. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to Wes Anderson's “The Darjeeling Limited,” which embraces absurdism, the epic of Beowulf revels in the triumph of purposeful action over existential randomness. Beowulf, with profound decisiveness, embarks on a deliberate pursuit of identity and legacy. Contrary to the absurdist notion where events unfold with unpredictable outcomes, Beowulf's tale is a testament to the power of individual will in shaping destiny. Indeed, Beowulf's motivations are  layered and intricate. Already endowed with wealth and nobility, his quest to confront Grendel, and subsequently Grendel's mother is a quest for meaning; to carve a lasting legacy through heroic deeds. This journey towards self-definition and heroic immortality contrasts sharply with the absurdist theme of life's inherent meaninglessness. Beowulf's venture, fueled by purpose, underscores a bold declaration of his values and aspirations. His willingness to risk everything, including his own life, elevates his journey beyond mere adventure; it becomes a definitive statement of his existence. Beowulf actively shapes his world, molding his destiny with the force of his will and the strength of his convictions.\r\n\r\nYet, one must take care not to assume that absurdism implies helplessness. Indeed, while it may appear as though absurdism instructs one to jump on the train, leaving their baggage behind (an obvious but pleasing metaphor in the final scene), Absurdism does no such thing. Absurdism is unlike an instruction manual or blueprint. Absurdism presents a kairotic individual the freedom to choose, with the implication that there is no correct choice, only choice itself. Certainly the audience groaned when Peter bought the Cobra, but when the Chief Steward was seen lovingly petting it later in the film, who could help but feel touched?\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Absurdism did not conceptually exist until a millennium after Beowulf was written. In other words, Beowulf does not reject absurdism as Beowulf is not aware of Absurdism's existence. To a rationale individual, sailing across the sea to fight a monster and it's mother is tomfoolery. Risking the lives of his men, and the hearts of their loved ones for irrational quest of a young man. Yet, because Beowulf succeeds he is bathed in glory. Sinisterly, how many heroes fell to Grendel and had no tales sung? Thus, analyzing the core motivation of honor and duty in Beowulf presents a challenge. The result of Beowulf's principles could be devastation. Therefore it must be understood that the principles(honor, duty, glory) themselves do not have a positive morality. From a Kantian perspective, the morality of Beowulf's actions would depend on whether his motives could be willed as a universal law. If Beowulf's actions were driven solely by personal glory or ambition, Kant might view them as morally questionable, as they prioritize personal gain over a universal moral law. Kantian philosophy, however, is elevated through the application of absurdism which rejects universal laws. In other words, while one could question the motives of Beowulf, the application of absurdism makes such questioning absurd to begin with.\r\n\r\nHere enters Camus, and his interpretation of the myth of Sisyphus, where Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity, finds meaning in his relentless endeavor. Torture, if one can convince themself of it, is hardly torture at all.  This is all to say that travel, like everything else, has no platonic purpose. In other words, neither the inception of a choice, nor the result of that choice are important. Only the journey, and what is gained along the way is meaningful. \r\n\r\nGiven that a metaphorical journey is meaningful, it can be understood that Travel acts as a manifestation of spiritual need. Just as Beowulf sails across the sea to confront monstrous adversaries, people in our world often embark on journeys, propelled by a mix of motivations including self-discovery, escape, or the pursuit of legacy. These journeys, while seemingly purposeful, often unfold in unpredictable ways, echoing the absurdist notion of life's inherent uncertainty. Travelers, much like Beowulf, might set out with a clear goal, but the lessons they learn and the transformations they undergo are often unforeseen, shaped by the nature of life. Indeed, while Beowulf is disappointed by his lack of heir, he dies knowing that his story (his journey) will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nTravel, like life, is not about the destination or the Kantian intent, but about the journey. It is unforeseeable; a surprise is down every alley. Travel is a journey into the heart of absurdism, where the pursuit itself becomes the purpose, and the lessons discovered along the way are more valuable than any treasure buried within a Dragon's hoard.\r\n\r\n![absurd travel](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1701902022793.png)"

    "content": "## Questioning the Etymology of Death\r\n\r\nHow death is regarded in each civilization is a dubious question, as death naturally has a shifting ontology as societies develop. With that said, relics of the past give us snapshots of society's perspective, contemporary relative to the artifact or document. The Egyptian “Book of the Dead” and the Mesopotamian “Epic of Gilgamesh” are examples that delineate their respective civilization's contemplations on death. These two artifacts make it clear that humans come to terms with death in vastly different and polarizing ways, especially in contrast with modern Western beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe \"Book of the Dead\" occupies a distinctive niche in ancient Egyptian thought. It's not just a text but a codified philosophy, mummifying their relationship with mortality. For Egyptians, death wasn't an end, but a journey to a different form of existence. Central to this perspective was the principle of \"ma'at.\" More than just balance, ma'at underscored the imperative of existence. In the solemn ceremony of death, one's heart—symbolizing a lifetime's deeds—was balanced against the feather of ma'at, a testament to the profundity of living with integrity. These abstract philosophies found concrete expression in the society's grand funerary tableau. Mummification wasn't mere preservation; it was a rite of passage. Pyramids were more than tombs; they were aspirations for an eternal legacy. \r\n\r\nThe \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" a classic of ancient Mesopotamian literature, offers a narrative that contrasts starkly but culminates similarly with the Egyptian codified rituals. This epic is a poignant odyssey into the human psyche's confrontation with mortality. When Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk, faces the bleak shadow of death through the demise of his comrade Enkidu, a profound existential crisis ensues. His quest, fervently seeking the elixir of immortality, becomes emblematic of humanity's perpetual struggle against the march of time. Yet, as Gilgamesh's journey unfolds, a revelation dawns. Immortality is not defying death's embrace but rather lies in legacy. In this way, the story of Gilgamesh teaches a lesson akin to the “Book of the Dead.” \r\n\r\nIn modern Western societies, the concept of death often evokes fear and is largely medicalized, quarantined away in hospices and hospitals. This contrasts sharply with the grand ceremonies of ancient Egypt and the existential odyssey in Mesopotamia. Where the Egyptians saw an eternal journey, contemporary (non-religious) views often fixate on finality rather than a continuation. Unlike Gilgamesh, who sought to etch his legacy in time, the modern Western focus is frequently on extending life through medical intervention, often without contemplating the significance of the legacy left behind. The contrast reveals a society much engaged in prolonging life but less immersed in the question of what that life means. \r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, when we consider instead the perspective of contemporary religious thinkers, this evaluation can be prodded, and holes unmasked. As in all things, humans operate on a gradient. I would argue that the 20th century has largely eliminated our roots through conflict on a scale unfathomable to nations of ancient history. Modern artifacts, especially after WW1 reflect this deviation. For example, Fountain by Marcel Duchamp, and other avant-garde artwork post WW1, highlight the hopelessness and lack of purpose which has grown and brewed, perhaps since Nietzsche. Perhaps what becomes most clear in the modern context, however, is that we have more ideas or records of ideas than ever before. In that sense, while generally less optimistic, the modern perspective of death has diversified. Thus we see that Humans come to terms with death in various ways, and while culture is a way to categorize these perceptions, overall death can be understood to have a shifting ontology.\r\n\r\n\r\n![death_etymology](/writing/images/death_etymology.png)"

    "content": "## Enlightenment vs Romanticism \r\n\r\n### Prompt:\r\nThe Enlightenment and the Romantic Movement in most ways can be seen as in opposition to each other. Nonetheless, they have both had a huge influence on modern Western civilization. Which one do you think has had the most positive influence in the modern world (meaning from the 18th century to the present)?\r\n\r\n### Essay:\r\nThe Enlightenment and the Romantic movement can be seen as in opposition to each other. The Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason took place in Europe and North America during the late 17th and early to mid 18th centuries. The Romantic movement, also known as Romanticism, originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century in response to the Enlightenment. Both the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement had tremendous cultural impacts. The Romantic movement focused on emotion and individualism, and The Enlightenment on reason and science. The Enlightenment transitioned away from individual bias and opinions to a purpose-driven, “general will” society. The Romantic movement looked for God in the natural world, embracing the juxtaposition of man and nature. Essentially, these movements strove to answer different questions: How versus Why. Ultimately, as with any political or cultural movement, there were positive and negative elements of each movement. In totality, from a utilitarianist perspective, the Enlightenment has (eventually) manifested into more impactful positives in modern society. The Romantic movement, while beautiful, has become obstructive in our post-modern society. Furthermore, the birth of nihilism and postmodernism in Nietzsche, and in legendary authors such as Cormac McCarthy reflect that as a society, we are rejecting the type of individualism from the Romantic movement in literature, or at least moving past it. Today, society appears to transition further down The Road to a post-humanist society, as reflected and glorified in Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto. Despite the profound cultural influence of both movements, the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, communal progress, and science, has had more impacts on our society. The Romantic movement's championing of emotion, individualism, and religious freedom, contributed to personal liberties and expressions. However, the world is entering an increasingly interconnected and technologically advanced era. The isolated man of the Romantic movement has been murdered. Therefore, the Enlightenment, due to its foundationally practical principles that continue to shape our approach to knowledge, governance, and societal progression, can be seen as having had more positive, active, influences on the modern world – even if it has also had more negative influence.\r\n\r\nHaving argued that the Romantic movement is dead today, I want to complicate the point by acknowledging that our current society reflects positive romantic individualism more prominently and productively than ever through personal liberty and expression. Consider the literal (gender) transition to a society that is more fluid, and flexible. Or the legalization of marriage for all sexualities. These are all positive examples that can be seen as derivatives of the Romantic movement. With that said, today we reflect a rejection of the individualism of the Romantic movement, rather than an embracing of it. Modern individualism - as exemplified by social media platforms - focuses on the communal validation of individual experiences, expressions, and identities. It's a form of individualism that seeks recognition and acceptance within a collective, rather than the Romantic individual who often stands in conflict with or apart from the collective. Even individualism has become communalism. The Romantic explorer simply lacks the firepower to contend with the artillery of the Enlightenment. Perhaps the movement died on the battlefield of World War I, in the clouds of gas suffocating the trenches, or when the English horses crumpled to the crossfire of the German machine guns. No individual can stand against the machine. \r\n\r\nWith that said, the Enlightenment movement was not entirely negative. The Enlightenment was an embrace of individual liberty, advocating for “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness”. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s influential work, \"Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men\" (1754), he introduced the concept of the \"general will.\" According to Rousseau this represented the collective desires and interests of the community, surpassing the individual wills of its members. I would contend that the legalizing of gay marriage is not the will of individuals, but is the general will of the populace, expressing our collective desire for a freer, more diverse, and equal society. Enlightenment concepts of personal freedom, equality, and the \"general will\" resonate within our democratic societies. We push for social and economic justice, environmental responsibility, and human rights. These are fundamentally Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing reason, equality, and liberty. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the Romantic movement, focusing on emotion and individualism, has left a complex legacy. Romantic idealization of individual feelings over societal norms has sometimes manifested in less desirable ways. The modern 'romantic' individual, once an explorer and muse of the natural world, exists instead as violent keyboard warrior. LARPing as Romantic: a caricature. These people represent the antithesis of the original Romantic movement and are a total perversion. In the age of social media, where individual views can be amplified to echo in chambers across the globe, Romantic individualism is now frequently misappropriated to oppose societal advancement. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, my argument is not to say that the Romantic movement was negative, but rather that the current influence of the Romantic movement is largely negative. In contrast, the Enlightenment continues to fund (literally) research toward making the world a better place. Enlightenment is the electricity that lights the road and acts as a path forward. Many of life’s difficulties have been resolved, reflected in our exploding population. The human species is thriving. \r\n\r\nDonna Haraway's work, particularly her “A Cyborg Manifesto,” highlights our transition from a Romantic to a postmodern perspective. Haraway uses the cyborg metaphor to critique rigid identity categories, advocating for a more fluid understanding of the self that allows for greater diversity and inclusivity. In Haraway's perspective, the cyborg disrupts the established order. This isn't about eliminating individual responsibilities, but rather breaking down restrictive boundaries — like those between human and machine, nature and culture, male and female. Through this lens, the traditional restrictions imposed on women, exemplified in works such as Amy Lowell’s \"Patterns\" (1915), can be deconstructed. Haraway's goal is not the enforcement of a \"general will,\" but the liberation of women and minorities from oppressive societal structures, enabling them to define their identities. Ironically, while Haraway's and other postmodernist thinkers’ advocacy for individual self-definition and liberation from societal constructs might seem to align with the Romantic movement's idealization of individualism and emotional authenticity, it's fundamentally different in critical ways. The Romantics typically idealized a return to nature and prized a sense of organic unity, often highlighting the distinct individual as a vital part of a larger, harmonious whole. Their work was often characterized by a revolt against the Enlightenment's strict rationality and an emphasis on emotion, intuition, and the primacy of the individual. In contrast, Haraway's work is not about embracing organic unity or a return to a more 'natural' state, but about moving beyond the traditional binaries and rigid categories that have long defined our understanding of identity. It's a postmodern approach that embraces hybridity, fluidity, and multiplicity, where identities and nature are not fixed by God but constructed and reconstructed by mankind. Haraway's idea of the cyborg rejects the Romantic's traditional dichotomies of nature versus culture and emotion versus reason. The cyborg, a fusion of organism and machine, represents a challenge to these dualistic ways of thinking. In this sense, while Haraway and the Romantics may both promote a form of individualism, they do so in fundamentally different ways, making Haraway's approach not an extension but rather a rejection of Romantic ideals. In this light, we can see that modern Gender and Sexuality progressives reject Romantic ideas. \r\n\r\nThus, while both the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement have shaped modern western civilization, the principles of the Enlightenment have had a more lasting impacts, ultimately equating to more positives. The Enlightenment's focus on reason, communal progress, and science has underpinned our approach to governance, societal progression, and knowledge. Meanwhile, the Romantic movement's championing of individualism and emotion has been recontextualized and perverted within a communal framework. As we navigate an interconnected and technologically advanced world, it's the Enlightenment's focus on reason and progress that continues to guide us, showing the Enlightenment's enduring and critical influence on our modern world.\r\n\r\n> Note that the prompt is not whether the Romantic vs Enlightment is in totality positive, but simply which one was more positive. In other words, 1 million negative influences and 10 positive influences is, by definition, more positive than 0 negative influences and 5 positives. Perhaps my argument is derived from semantics, but what else would justify a stance on the subjective?\r\n\r\n![death_etymology](/writing/images/enlightenment.png)"

    "content": "## Stone and Spirit: Tracing Architecture and Meaning in the Ancient World\r\n\r\nThe architectural record of human history is rich with layers that reveal the intricacies of societal values, technological advancements, and religious ideologies. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN), Neolithic, and finally Ancient Egyptian architectures offer a particularly intriguing exploration due to societal and technological complexity shifting. This essay aims to contrast these periods of humanity by focusing on three dimensions of their architecture: the methods of construction, which reveal technological sophistication and communal participation; the functional purposes of their principal structures, which range from utilitarian shelters to monumental tombs; and the embedded religious and cosmological messages that articulate each culture's perception of life, the afterlife, and meaning. Specifically, we will briefly analyze the Göbekli Tepe, before focusing on Newgrange and the Great Pyramids. This essay aims to contrast these architectural legacies to reflect their epochs' societal norms and spiritual paradigms while also offering insights into humanity's seemingly futile yet omnipresent ‘conquest’ for permanence and meaning. \r\n\r\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic period represents a pivotal moment in architectural history, marking the period of shift from a nomadic lifestyle to the beginnings of settled communities. The Göbekli Tepe (~9,600BCE) is an impressive landmark of this era, exemplifying the innovative use of available resources and manual labor for construction. Despite the absence of advanced tools or the wheel, these civilizations showcased remarkable engineering skills. The Göbekli Tepe is a fascinating example, showcasing a spiritual and technical depth far beyond its contemporaries. Klaus Schmidt writes, translated from German, “The Göbekli Tepe presents its visitors with terrifying scenarios: merged eyes, teeth flashing animal sculptures and reliefs evoke an impression of a Dante-esque Inferno.” The site boasts monumental stone circles and is further enriched by more minor artifacts used in cultic practices, a predecessor of design techniques prevalent in Upper Mesopotamia. These served as potent symbols, perhaps to communicate spiritual or societal constructs, potentially emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between wild predatory animals and their corresponding deities. The direction in which these pillars are viewed and how their images and symbols are interpreted inside the surroundings are still subjects of debate. One can assume, for example, that they show apocalyptic scenes, which offer both a warning to the viewer and potentially a protective blessing. Regardless of one’s interpretation, the architecture and especially the carvings of the Göbekli Tepe showcase that humanity has maintained a resonant relationship with art, meaning, and religion, thousands of years before modern civilization. \r\n\r\nContinuing our exploration, the Neolithic period heralds a subsequent layer in architectural chronology, distinguished by technological ingenuity manifested in edifices like Newgrange. This monument epitomizes sophisticated construction techniques, such as corbelling, a method of layering stones ingeniously to create a stable structure. Unlike the communal endeavors of its predecessors, the construction of Newgrange possibly indicates the advent of hierarchical societal structures, suggesting the mobilization of labor through centralized authority. The monument's design also manifests hydrological awareness; the corbelled stones are deliberately tilted outward and downward to channel rainwater away. Intriguingly, the edifice's alignment and roofbox above the entrance allow the rising sun to illuminate its innermost chamber, a likely tribute to the geographical and seasonal conditions that characterized its far-northern locale. Additionally, Newgrange and Maeshowe have been found to contain similar artifacts, such as carved and standing stones and human remains, to other Neolithic monuments, alluding to solid cultural ties between them. The neolithic period extends its architectural footprint as far north as the Orkney Islands off Scotland's coast, epitomized by the Maeshowe Tumulus Tomb and to other Neolithic structures like Stonehenge. Further exemplifying the evidence for cultural significance, it is shown that there are more tombs per square foot and square mile in the Orkney Islands, and more standing stones, than the less remote sites in England. In summation, the architectural marvels of these epochs—from Newgrange, and extending to the ritual significance of the winter solstice at Stonehenge—serve to articulate a range of human ponderance. They are not merely technical feats but also intricate philosophical treatises carved in stone, exploring themes of life, death, and the elements, such as water, that sustain us. Together, these structures stand as testaments to the profound layers of thought and symbolism that have guided human civilization, illuminating our ceaseless quest for meaning even as they are bathed in the cyclical light of celestial events.\r\n\r\nShockingly, Ancient Egypt, while producing architecture at a scale unfathomable to the Neolithic age, used engineering techniques that would ultimately be familiar to people of the Neolithic age. With that said, Ancient Egyptian architecture serves as a compelling counterpoint to its Neolithic predecessor, characterized by monumental scale and intricate symbolism. Employing engineering techniques such as ramps, sledges, and counterweights, and even wetting sand to reduce friction, Egypt achieved iconic masterpieces like the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx. These monumental structures diverge from mere functionality; they are grand tomes scripted in stone, expressing a complex cosmology and religious ideology. While the Neolithic era focused on utilitarian and funerary needs, Egyptian architecture escalated the stakes, manifesting as ostentatious tombs, temples, and palaces. These edifices not only attest to the society's technological prowess but also serve as material lexicons, decoding Egypt's nuanced perspectives on mortality, divinity, and the cosmos. The elevated scale of their architectural endeavor, like the grandeur of the Pyramids of Giza, required superior technology and a hierarchical organization of labor, often mobilizing a workforce in the tens of thousands. This speaks to a level of societal complexity and specialization absent in Neolithic communities. However, both civilizations shared a communal aspect; their major projects were likely collective endeavors that required broad societal participation. With that said, the theocratic monarchy of Egypt could strong-arm the population (including a large slave population) into work. In essence, while the Neolithic architects were artisans of necessity, turning constraints into innovations, their Egyptian counterparts were the maestros of excess, utilizing advanced techniques to translate grand visions into stone. In their unique ways, both epitomized the indomitable human spirit to manipulate the physical world, governed by the technological limits and societal ambitions of their respective times. \r\n\r\nWhen considering the functional dimensions of Neolithic and Ancient Egyptian architectures, we discern a pragmatic evolution that transitions from fundamental utility to grandiosity imbued with symbolic purpose. Neolithic structures primarily responded to basic societal needs: shelter and burial. For instance, the Dolmen and Tumulus tombs served as repositories for the deceased, whereas other structures like Göbekli Tepe might have functioned as communal or ritualistic spaces. These buildings, while utilitarian, also initiated a rudimentary form of symbolic expression that hinted at emerging cosmological ideas. In stark contrast, Egyptian architecture was more specialized and encompassed a broader typological range. While tombs remained a consistent theme, manifesting in monumental forms like the Pyramids, the Egyptians also erected intricate temples and opulent palaces. These structures transcended mere utility; they were cosmic diagrams materialized in stone, designed to reflect and appease the celestial order. Thus, Egyptian buildings communicated complex religious ideologies and assertions of political power. Despite these differences, a shared thematic undercurrent persists: both civilizations constructed edifices that transcended their immediate functional roles, serving as expressions of broader cultural narratives. In Neolithic settings, these were fledgling narratives of community and perhaps spirituality; in Egyptian contexts, they were grand epics of divinity, mortality, and imperial splendor. Therefore, both cultures, each in its own idiom, articulated a dual function for their structures—practical utility and symbolic expression—making them indelible artifacts of their respective cultural milieus.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of both Neolithic and Ancient Egyptian civilizations articulates each culture's spiritual doctrines and conceptions of life and the afterlife. In the Pre-Pottery Neolithic context, while the specific belief systems remain enigmatic due to scant textual evidence, structures like Göbekli Tepe suggest a burgeoning spiritual consciousness. The intricate carvings of animals and abstract shapes could represent totemic symbols or cosmological motifs, denoting a primal theology rooted in nature and the cycles of life and death. Newgrange and Maeshowe's architectural achievements in the Neolithic context reveal technological innovation and a profound understanding of celestial events, likely tied to spiritual or ritualistic practices. Artifacts and burial structures like Dolmen and Tumulus tombs may suggest ancestral veneration or a nascent belief in an afterlife. Conversely, Ancient Egyptian architecture is replete with explicit theological declarations. The Pyramids, for instance, were not just tombs but metaphysical blueprints, embodying the Pharaoh's journey to the afterlife and designed in alignment with celestial bodies to ensure cosmic harmony. Temples and palaces often featured intricate hieroglyphics and reliefs detailing religious myths, rituals, and the pantheon of gods and goddesses. These were not merely places of worship but cosmograms, illustrating the Egyptians' complex spiritual landscape encompassing notions of Ma'at (cosmic order), the Ka (spirit), and an intricate afterlife. While the Neolithic structures serve as rudimentary sketches, leaving much to interpretation, the Egyptian edifices are more like detailed religious manuscripts, delineating sophisticated spiritual schemas. Yet, both reflect an inherent human propensity to imbue architecture with layers of meaning that transcend the material, serving as conduits between the terrestrial and the transcendent. Thus, while differing vastly in complexity and explicitness, both civilizations used architecture as a medium to explore and articulate their existential queries and spiritual aspirations.\r\n\r\n![death_etymology](/writing/images/stone_spirit.png)"

Narcissism, as a trait, does often carry a negative connotation, particularly in its extreme forms as seen in narcissistic personality disorder. However, it's important to recognize that self-focus or self-interest is a natural part of the human experience. It's a spectrum, and a certain degree of self-regard is necessary for survival and personal development.\r\n\r\nThe myth of Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection, serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of excessive self-love and the inability to connect with others. But, as you've noted, it's also a story about staying true to oneself. The key is balance—recognizing and valuing oneself without losing the capacity for empathy and connection with others.\r\n\r\nIn the context of Pessoa, a renowned writer known for his introspection and multiple heteronyms, the exploration of self can be seen as a deep dive into the human psyche, not necessarily as narcissism in its pathological form. Pessoa's work could be interpreted as an intense examination of the self, which is a central theme in much of literature and philosophy.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, while narcissism in its extreme is detrimental, a healthy level of self-focus is a part of the human condition, and it plays a crucial role in our personal and creative lives.\r\n\r\nSELF\r\n\r\nTurn jnto a poem\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\n\r\nIn the mirror of the mind, Pessoa's gaze, Reflects a truth that through the ages stays. A touch of narcissism, softly lined, Not malice, but self-awareness defined.\r\n\r\nWe all, in mirrors of our souls, do peer, Seeking ourselves, both far and near. A spectrum wide, where self-love sits, Not always dark, but in light it flits.\r\n\r\nNarcissus, by his own reflection bound, In love with self, a caution found. Yet in his tale, a truth does gleam, To know oneself, a timeless dream.\r\n\r\nPessoa, with introspective eye, In written word, his self does ply. Not narcissism in a harmful guise, But a journey inward, where wisdom lies.\r\n\r\nA balance sought, between self and world, Empathy's flag, gently unfurled.

It references Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese poet known for his introspection and existential musings. The poem uses a blend of languages – English, French, Japanese, and Portuguese – to capture the fragmented and multifaceted nature of the self, much like Pessoa's heteronyms.\r\n\r\nThe central theme is narcissism, compared to a dangerous, wild-growing weed. This metaphor suggests the insidious and pervasive nature of narcissism, which can distort self-perception and lead to isolation. The repeated references to mirrors and echoes symbolize the self-absorption and lack of true connection that characterizes narcissism. The poem warns of the dangers of being consumed by one's own image and losing touch with reality and empathy.\r\n\r\nPessoa's presence in the poem serves as a symbolic guide through this labyrinth of self. His work often explored similar themes of identity and the masks we wear. The fractured linguistic style underscores the disorienting effect of narcissism, where the self is both the subject and object of its obsession, leading to a loss of balance and a heavy tilt towards self above all else.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this poem is a rich, multi-lingual exploration of the themes of self, narcissism, and the existential journey, drawing inspiration from Pessoa's introspective poetry.\r\n\r\n------\r\n# NEW CHAT: analyze my meta-poem (pasted the previous two conversations in full)\r\n------\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\nYour meta-poem is an intricate exploration of the complexities surrounding the concept of self and narcissism, utilizing a fusion of multiple languages to deepen its thematic resonance. This linguistic blend not only pays homage to Fernando Pessoa's multi-faceted identity but also mirrors the fragmented and multifarious nature of the human psyche.\r\n\r\n1. **Multilingual Approach**: By weaving English, French, Portuguese, and Japanese (in Romaji), your poem transcends linguistic barriers, symbolizing the universality of the themes it discusses. The varying languages also reflect the disoriented and multifaceted nature of self-perception, akin to looking into a kaleidoscopic mirror.\r\n\r\n2. **Narcissism as a Central Theme**: Narcissism, depicted as a pervasive and potentially harmful weed, serves as the central metaphor. This choice effectively conveys the dangers of excessive self-absorption and the gradual loss of connection with reality and empathy. It speaks to the self-consuming nature of narcissism, which can lead to a distorted self-image and isolation.\r\n\r\n3. **Use of Mirrors and Echoes**: The imagery of mirrors and echoes throughout the poem is poignant. Mirrors symbolize self-reflection and, in the context of narcissism, self-obsession. Echoes, on the other hand, represent the hollow, resonating nature of such an obsession, where the self is both the seeker and the sought, leading to an endless, self-referential loop.\r\n\r\n4. **Pessoa as a Symbolic Figure**: Incorporating Pessoa, renowned for his existential and introspective poetry, lends depth to your poem. He navigates the labyrinth of self, embodying the journey of self-exploration and the inherent risks of becoming lost within oneself. This aligns with Pessoa's exploration of identity and the complexity of human nature.\r\n\r\n5. **Fractured Linguistic Style**: The mixed-language structure underscores the disorienting effect of narcissism on one's identity. The fluid transition between languages symbolizes the non-linear and often chaotic journey of self-discovery, highlighting the difficulty of maintaining a balanced self-perception.\r\n\r\n6. **Existential Undertones**: The poem encapsulates an existential journey into the self. It delves into the human struggle with identity, self-perception, and the impact of introspection. The multilingual composition not only adds to the complexity of this exploration but also broadens its accessibility and relatability.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, your meta-poem is a sophisticated, multi-lingual tapestry that captures the essence of human introspection, the pitfalls of narcissism, and the continuous quest for self-understanding. It's a compelling homage to Pessoa's legacy and a profound commentary on the human condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n![other](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1702113942594.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

We must take this to mean not only that I must—necessarily—constantly carry along with me what I wish to flee from but also that I have to aim at the object I am fleeing from in order to flee it; in other words, my anguish, my intentional aiming at anguish, and my flight from anguish toward reassuring myths must be given within the unity of a single consciousness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> flight from anguish is just one way of becoming conscious of anguish.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Bad (Location and)\r\n> “Consciousness is a being for whom in its being there is consciousness of the nothingness of its being.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Forms (Location Bad)\r\n> The meaning of this look is not, and that is what bothers me.

But if the reflecting is nothing but a reflecting of this reflection, and if the reflection can be characterized only by its “being-in-order-to be reflected in this reflecting,” the two terms of the quasi-dyad, bracing their two nothingnesses against each other, are jointly annihilated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Knowledge (Location a)\r\n> But if, on the other hand, the reflection was something—independently of its being-in-order-to-be-reflected—we would have to qualify it not as a reflection but as in-itself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Knowledge (Location a)\r\n> The reflection can only be “something to be reflected” and at the same time nothing if it becomes qualified by something other than itself or, alternatively, if it is reflected as a relation to an “outside” that it is not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Knowledge (Location a)\r\n> qua negativity—“ not being beautiful” is a real quality of myself, and this negative quality explains my melancholy, for example, just as effectively as my lack of worldly success.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Quality (Location Quantity,)\r\n> Every attempt made by the donkey to catch the carrot has the effect of moving the harnessed cart forward in its entirety—along with the carrot itself, which remains always at the same distance from the donkey.

About the Author\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 811 (Location Location)\r\n> Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) was one of the great philosophers of the twentieth century and a renowned novelist, dramatist, and political activist. As a teenager, Sartre was drawn to philosophy after reading Henri Bergson’s Time and Free Will. He passed the agrégation in philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1929. His first novel, La Nausée, which Sartre considered one of his best works, was published in 1938. Sartre served as a meteorologist in the French army before being captured by German troops in 1940 and spending nine months as a prisoner of war. He continued to write during his captivity and, after his release, published his great trilogy of novels, Les Chemins de la Liberté. In 1964, Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but declined it. During the uprisings of 1968, he was arrested for civil disobedience but was swiftly released by President Charles de Gaulle, who allegedly said, “One does not arrest Voltaire.” Sartre died on April 15, 1980, in Paris, and his funeral attracted an enormous crowd of more than fifty thousand mourners. He is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. Index\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 854 (Location Location)\r\n> TN: Cet objet… appréhendé à travers la douleur, c’est le mal. In French the expression avoir mal is used to mean “to have a pain (or ache),” or in instances where in English we would say something hurts. On its own, le mal also means “evil,” and possibly Sartre intends a pun here. As Sartre is describing the creation of a psychological object, it seems important to translate le mal as a noun, and obviously it needs to be some noun other than “pain” (which I use, contrastively, to translate douleur). “Ache” seems to be the term that works best.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](/writing/images/being_and_nothingness.jpeg)\r\n"

The Danes’ lord, shepherd of his people heard Beowulf’s brave resolve, and with confident hope they turned to him for help.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 274 (Location undefined)\r\n> The two contenders fought, the story goes, so fiercely that they smashed mead benches with their gold fixings and lifted them from the floor. Part II\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 320 (Location undefined)\r\n> Hrothgar approached the mead-hall and spoke from the steps under the high roof, gazing at the eaves adorned with gold, and Grendel’s arm.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 346 (Location undefined)\r\n> As victory’s reward for Beowulf the son of Healfdene presented him with a great battle standard woven with gold, a helmet and chain-mail shirt, and a sword, Healfdene’s sword, a renowned and precious blade. Part III\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 455 (Location undefined)\r\n> ‘It is better to revenge a loss than to brood in mourning. For each one of us an end must come to living in this world. We must labour for renown and glory. When a warrior is gone that is his best memorial.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 567 (Location undefined)\r\n> Heorot soared, the hall vast and golden in the night; the guest slept until the raven proclaimed it sunrise and the shadows of the night were chased off by morning brightness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 589 (Location undefined)\r\n> Beowulf the warrior, proud and glorious with gold crossed the plain, exalting in his treasure\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 590 (Location undefined)\r\n> Tugging at its anchor, his ship waited for its master. On the journey Hrothgar was often praised, for generosity a matchless king, until old age took his strength away from him, as it does to all men. Part IV\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 596 (Location undefined)\r\n> The mast towered over the cargo of heirlooms from Hrothgar’s hoard. Beowulf gave the guard who watched their ship a sword mounted with gold, a man who thereafter was more honoured on the mead bench with his treasure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 656 (Location undefined)\r\n> ‘Once morning came, we sat at the feasting, and the leader of the Scyldings paid well for my part in the struggle, beaten gold and much else. Part V\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 695 (Location undefined)\r\n> The witness who outlived all the others, a gold-guardian, grieving his people, expected their fate, and knew that he would enjoy the gathered treasure for only a little while longer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 700 (Location undefined)\r\n> The thanes are all gone. The iron helmet, hasped with bright gold, will lose its ornament; the retainers sleep who would polish battle masks. The mail-shirts that once withstood the bite of swords in the fray when the shield shattered, turn to dust with the warrior: the links will no longer range far and wide on the warlord’s back with his company. No humming harp remains now, no fierce hawk swoops about the hall, nor does a fleet horse paw the yard. Slaughter has emptied the earth of my people.’ So he mourned as he walked the world, lamenting day and night until death’s tide flooded his heart. Part VI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 871 (Location undefined)\r\n> The vile dragon, the under-earth robber of his life was robbed of life too, outright. No longer would its snake-coils twist about the gold in its treasure hoard: the hard-edged blade, the hammered battle iron had claimed it. Now the sky-roamer lay rigid, stilled, and brought to ground beside its treasure lair.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 881 (Location undefined)\r\n> ‘Who values truth would surely say the lord who granted you treasure and the war-gear you still wear, who bestowed the helmet and mail-shirt to his thanes in the mead-hall, the finest arms a prince could give a man, threw his gold away as if it were dung.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 937 (Location undefined)\r\n> It was a legacy under curse, that gold of men long dead, enchanted so that none might enter the treasure lair and plunder, save for the warrior whom God himself the giver of victory, might allow a warrior that was worthy to Him.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 945 (Location undefined)\r\n> ‘Often when one man pursues his own will alone many suffer for it. So it is now. Nothing we could say would counsel our lord, the prince we loved, guardian of our land to refuse combat with the gold-keeper, let it lie unmolested underground in darkness till the world came to an end. He held hard to his high destiny there. The hoard is bare but bitterly bartered. The fate was too cruel that brought him to this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 970 (Location undefined)\r\n> After, they buried the neck torques of twisted gold and jewels, and a hoard of such treasured things as brave men had brought from the dragon lair after Beowulf died. They returned it to the ground that treasure and there it rests as useless to men as it ever was.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![meno](/writing/images/beowulf.jpeg)"

Astounded and distressed. My perfectionist instinct should inhibit me from finishing; it should inhibit me from even beginning. But I get distracted and start doing something. What I achieve is not the product of an act of my will but of my will’s surrender. I begin because I don’t have the strength to think; I finish because I don’t have the courage to quit. This book is my cowardice. Preface\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Location)\r\n> Fairly tall and thin, he must have been about thirty years old. He hunched over terribly when sitting down but less so standing up, and he dressed with a carelessness that wasn’t entirely careless.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Location)\r\n> In his pale, uninteresting face there was a look of suffering that didn’t add any interest, and it was difficult to say just what kind of suffering this look suggested. It seemed to suggest various kinds: hardships, anxieties, and the suffering born of the indifference that comes from having already suffered a lot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 6 (Location Location)\r\n> His voice was hesitant and colourless, as in those who hope for nothing because it’s perfectly useless to hope. But perhaps it was absurd to see this in my supper-time peer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 6 (Location Location)\r\n> Furthermore, he added, this art wasn’t exactly a novelty for him, and he shyly observed that, having nowhere to go and nothing to do, nor friends to visit, nor any interest in reading books, he usually spent his nights at home, in his rented room, likewise writing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 6 (Location Location)\r\n> He explained that with this kind of an interior he could ‘maintain the dignity of tedium’. In rooms decorated in the modern style, tedium becomes a discomfort, a physical distress.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 6 (Location Location)\r\n> But even if I always felt that I was relating to an assumed personality and that he didn’t really consider me his friend, I realized from the beginning that he needed someone to whom he could leave the book that he left.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location Location)\r\n> I remained just as much his friend, devoted to the end for which he’d drawn me to himself–the publication of this book. The Book of Disquiet\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Factless (Location >)\r\n> These are my Confessions, and if in them I say nothing, it’s because I have nothing to say.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 11)\r\n> And since the human spirit naturally tends to make judgements based on feeling instead of reason, most of these young people chose Humanity to replace God.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 11)\r\n> The cult of Humanity, with its rites of Freedom and Equality, always struck me as a revival of those ancient cults in which gods were like animals or had animal heads.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 11)\r\n> Decadence is the total loss of unconsciousness, which is the very basis of life. Could it think, the heart would stop beating.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 12)\r\n> Taking nothing seriously and recognizing our sensations as the only reality we have for certain, we take refuge there, exploring them like large unknown countries.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 12)\r\n> This isn’t the viewpoint of pessimists like Vigny,* for whom life was a prison in which he wove straw to keep busy and forget. To be a pessimist is to see everything tragically, an attitude that’s both excessive and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 12)\r\n> While it’s true that we ascribe no value to the work we produce and that we produce it to keep busy, we’re not like the prisoner who busily weaves straw to forget about his fate; we’re like the girl who embroiders pillows for no other reason than to keep busy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 12)\r\n> I see life as a roadside inn where I have to stay until the coach from the abyss pulls up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 13)\r\n> Night will fall on us all and the coach will pull up. I enjoy the breeze I’m given and the soul I was given to enjoy it with, and I no longer question or seek. If what I write in the book of travellers can, when read by others at some future date, also entertain them on their journey, then fine. If they don’t read it, or are not entertained, that’s fine too.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 14)\r\n> But there’s something else… In these languid and empty hours, a sadness felt by my entire being rises from my soul to my mind–a bitter awareness that everything is a sensation of mine and at the same time something external, something not in my power to change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 15)\r\n> The nocturnal glory of being great without being anything! The sombre majesty of splendours no one knows… And I suddenly experience the sublime feeling of a monk in the wilderness or of a hermit in his retreat, acquainted with the substance of Christ in the sands and in the caves of withdrawal from the world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 16)\r\n> I asked for very little from life, and even this little was denied me. A nearby field, a ray of sunlight, a little bit of calm along with a bit of bread, not to feel oppressed by the knowledge that I exist, not to demand anything from others, and not to have others demand anything from me–this was denied me, like the spare change we might deny a beggar not because we’re mean-hearted but because we don’t feel like unbuttoning our coat.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 16)\r\n> Me in this fourth-floor room, interrogating life!, saying what souls feel!, writing prose like a genius or a famous author! Me, here, a genius!…\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 17)\r\n> it was a part of me which would remain with all of them, and that to separate myself from them would be a partial death.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 17)\r\n> We all have a Vasques who’s the boss–visible for some of us, invisible for others. My Vasques goes by that very name, and he’s a hale and pleasant man, occasionally short-tempered but never two-faced, self-interested but basically fair, with a sense of justice that’s lacking in many great geniuses and human marvels of civilization, right and left.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 17)\r\n> But since in life we must all be exploited, I wonder if it’s any worse to be exploited by Vasques and his fabrics than by vanity, by glory, by resentment, by envy or by the impossible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 18)\r\n> Some are exploited by God himself, and they are prophets and saints in this vacuous world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 18)\r\n> Or I’ll be in an institution for paupers, happy in my utter defeat, mixed up with the rabble of would-be geniuses who were no more than beggars with dreams, thrown in with the anonymous throng of those who didn’t have strength enough to conquer nor renunciation enough to conquer by not competing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 19)\r\n> For me he is everything, externally speaking, because for me Life is whatever is external.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 19)\r\n> the office on the Rua dos Douradores represents life for me, the fourth-floor room* where I live, on this same Rua dos Douradores, represents Art for me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 20)\r\n> Everything in me tends to go on to become something else.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 20)\r\n> Everything interests me, but nothing holds me. I attend to everything, dreaming all the while.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 20)\r\n> I’m two, and both keep their distance–Siamese twins that aren’t attached.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 20)\r\n> We never know self-realization. We are two abysses–a well staring at the sky.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 21)\r\n> What is there to confess that’s worthwhile or useful? What has happened to us has happened to everyone or only to us; if to everyone, then it’s no novelty, and if only to us, then it won’t be understood.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 21)\r\n> My elderly aunt would play solitaire throughout the endless evening. These confessions of what I feel are my solitaire.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 21)\r\n> My worthless self lives on at the bottom of every expression, like an indissoluble residue at the bottom of a glass from which only water was drunk.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 22)\r\n> It may be poor, but it exists, like the miserable plant in the lone flowerpot of my neighbour who’s crippled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 23)\r\n> Inch by inch I conquered the inner terrain I was born with. Bit by bit I reclaimed the swamp in which I’d languished. I gave birth to my infinite being, but I had to wrench myself out of me with forceps.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 24)\r\n> If I had the world in my hand, I’m quite sure I would trade it for a ticket to Rua dos Douradores.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 25)\r\n> But when the illusion was over, the dead clamour sounded yet again, and the dogs could be seen nervously hesitating on the tree-lined paths. It was all absurd, like mourning the dead, and princesses from other people’s dreams strolled about freely and indefinitely.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 26)\r\n> When I gingerly remove the noose, it’s with my own hands that I nearly strangle myself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 26)\r\n> Whether or not they exist, we’re slaves to the gods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 26)\r\n> God is the fact that we exist and that’s not all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 27)\r\n> The only way to be in agreement with life is to disagree with ourselves. Absurdity is divine.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 27)\r\n> Let’s buy books so as not to read them; let’s go to concerts without caring to hear the music or to see who’s there; let’s take long walks because we’re sick of walking; and let’s spend whole days in the country, just because it bores us.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 29)\r\n> For their future? For their unconsciousness?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 30)\r\n> Literature–which is art married to thought, and realization untainted by reality–seems to me the end towards which all human effort would have to strive, if it were truly human and not just a welling up of our animal self. To express something is to conserve its virtue and take away its terror.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 30)\r\n> The novelist is all of us, and we narrate whenever we see, because seeing is complex like everything.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 30)\r\n> I’ll let the fever of saying put me to sleep instead, and with closed eyes I’ll stroke, as if petting a cat, all that I might have said.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 30)\r\n> A breath of music or of a dream, of something that would make me almost feel, something that would make me not think.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 31)\r\n> I paced from one side of the room to the other, dreaming out loud incoherent and impossible things–deeds I’d forgotten to do, hopeless ambitions haphazardly realized, fluid and lively conversations which, were they to be, would already have been.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 32)\r\n> Ah, it’s my longing for whom I might have been that distracts and torments me! Who would I be now if I’d received the affection that comes from the womb and is placed, through kisses, on a baby’s face?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 33)\r\n> whispered in secret to someone who doesn’t know me!…\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 34)\r\n> Absurdity, confusion, oblivion–everything that isn’t life…\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 34)\r\n> I hear time fall, drop by drop, and not one drop that falls can be heard.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 35)\r\n> During the first days of Autumn when nightfall arrives suddenly, as if prematurely, and it seems we took longer to do our day’s work, I enjoy, while still working, the thought of not working which the darkness brings, for the darkness is night, and night means sleep, home, freedom.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 36)\r\n> Sometimes I think I’ll never leave the Rua dos Douradores. And having written this, it seems to me eternity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 37)\r\n> … and a deep and weary disdain for all those who work for mankind, for all those who fight for their country and give their lives so that civilization may continue… … a disdain full of disgust for those who don’t realize that the only reality is each man’s soul, and that everything else–the exterior world and other people–is but an unaesthetic nightmare, like the result, in dreams, of a mental indigestion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 39)\r\n> All of a sudden, as if a surgical hand of destiny had operated on a long-standing blindness with immediate and sensational results, I lift my gaze from my anonymous life to the clear recognition of how I live. And I see that everything I’ve done, thought or been is a species of delusion or madness. I’m amazed by what I managed not to see. I marvel at all that I was and that I now see I’m not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 39)\r\n> I didn’t even act anything out. I was the role that got acted. At most, I was the actor’s motions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 39)\r\n> All that I’ve done, thought or been is a series of submissions, either to a false self that I assumed belonged to me because I expressed myself through it to the outside, or to a weight of circumstances that I supposed was the air I breathed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 41)\r\n> I feel like a sick man who has been getting steadily worse, until at last he calmly and without regret extends his feeble hands over the bedspread he had been clutching.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 41)\r\n> Whenever I see a dead body, death seems to me a departure. The corpse looks to me like a suit that was left behind. Someone went away and didn’t need to take the one and only outfit he’d worn.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 42)\r\n> I realize that, while often happy and often cheerful, I’m always sad. And the part of me that realizes this is behind me, as if bent over my leaning self at the window, as if looking over my shoulder or even over my head to contemplate, with eyes more intimate than my own, the slow and now wavy rain which filigrees the grey and inclement air.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 43)\r\n> I have no peace, nor even–alas!–the desire to have it…\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 47)\r\n> ‘I’m the size of what I see!’ Each time I think on this phrase with all my nerves, the more it seems destined to redesign the whole starry universe.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 48)\r\n> To understand, I destroyed myself. To understand is to forget about loving.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 50)\r\n> The beauty of a naked body is only appreciated by cultures that use clothing. Modesty is important for sensuality like resistance for energy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 53)\r\n> But I’m unable to envision myself in these lofty roles without a hearty snicker from the other I that’s always near by, like a downtown street. See myself famous? What I see is a famous bookkeeper. Feel myself raised to the thrones of renown?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 57)\r\n> And today, thinking about what my life has been, I feel like some sort of animal that’s being carried in a basket under a curved arm between two suburban train stations. The image is stupid, but the life it defines is even more stupid.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 59)\r\n> Whenever my ambition, influenced by my dreams, raised up above the everyday level of my life, so that for a moment I seemed to soar, like a child on a swing, I always–like the child–had to come down to the public garden and face my defeat, with no flags to wave in battle and no sword I was strong enough to unsheathe.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 60)\r\n> My hapless peers with their lofty dreams–how I envy and despise them! I’m with the others, with the even more hapless, who have no one but themselves to whom they can tell their dreams and show what would be verses if they wrote them. I’m with these poor slobs who have no books to show, who have no literature besides their own soul, and who are suffocating to death due to the fact they exist without having taken that mysterious, transcendental exam that makes one eligible to live.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 64)\r\n> We all have our vanity, and that vanity is our way of forgetting that there are other people with a soul like our own. My vanity consists of a few pages, passages, doubts… I reread? A lie! I don’t dare reread. I can’t reread. What good would it do me to reread? The person in the writing is someone else. I no longer understand a thing…\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 65)\r\n> We generally colour our ideas of the unknown with our notions of the known. If we call death a sleep, it’s because it seems like sleep on the outside; if we call death a new life, it’s because it seems like something different from life. With slight misconceptions of reality we fabricate our hopes and beliefs, and we live off crusts that we call cakes, like poor children who make believe they’re happy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 68)\r\n> The consciousness of life’s unconsciousness is the oldest tax levied on the intelligence.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 68)\r\n> If I have no other virtue, I at least have the permanent novelty of free, uninhibited sensation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 69)\r\n> I suddenly felt something like tenderness for that man. I felt the tenderness one feels for common human banality, for the daily routine of the family breadwinner going to work, for his humble and happy home, for the happy and sad pleasures that necessarily make up his life, for the innocence of living without analysing, for the animal naturalness of that coat-covered back.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 70)\r\n> The cause of my profound sense of incompatibility with others is, I believe, that most people think with their feelings, whereas I feel with my thoughts.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 73)\r\n> The blue of the sky showing between the still clouds was smudged with transparent white.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 73)\r\n> I don’t need fast cars or express trains to feel the delight and terror of speed. All I require is a tram and my gift for abstraction, which I’ve developed to an astonishing degree.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 77)\r\n> Everything wearies me, including what doesn’t weary me. My happiness is as painful as my pain.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 80)\r\n> thinking? Nothing, which is why I let myself think it. Around the square the streetcars grumble and clang. They look like giant yellow mobile matchboxes,\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 81)\r\n> Today, during a break from feeling, I reflected on the style of my prose. Exactly how do I write? I had, like many others, the perverted desire to adopt a system and a norm. It’s true that I wrote before having the norm and the system, but so did everyone else.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 83)\r\n> Metaphysics has always struck me as a prolonged form of latent insanity. If we knew the truth, we’d see it; everything else is systems and approximations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 84)\r\n> When I put away my artifices and lovingly arrange in a corner all my toys, words, images and phrases, so dear to me I feel like kissing them, then I become so small and innocuous, so alone in a room so large and sad, so profoundly sad!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 86)\r\n> A glimpse of open country above a stone wall on the outskirts of town is more liberating for me than an entire journey would be for someone else.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 87)\r\n> There was a time when I was irritated by certain things that today make me smile. And one of those things, which I’m reminded of nearly every day, is the way men who are active in day-to-day life smile at poets and artists.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 87)\r\n> Life being fundamentally a mental state, and all that we do or think valid to the extent we consider it valid, the valuation depends on us. The dreamer is an issuer of banknotes, and the notes he issues circulate in the city of his mind just like real notes in the world outside. Why should I care if the currency of my soul will never be convertible to gold, when there is no gold in life’s factitious alchemy?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 91)\r\n> By thinking so much, I became echo and abyss. By delving within, I made myself into many.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 92)\r\n> We are who we’re not, and life is quick and sad. The sound of the waves at night is a sound of the night, and how many have heard it in their own soul, like the perpetual hope that dissolves in the darkness with a faint plash of distant foam!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 94)\r\n> The truly wise man is the one who can keep external events from changing him in any way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 98)\r\n> How many Caesars I’ve been, but not the real ones.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 100)\r\n> To conform is to submit, and to conquer is to conform, to be conquered. Thus every victory is a debasement. The conqueror inevitably loses all the virtues born of frustration with the status quo that led him to the fight that brought victory. He becomes satisfied, and only those who conform–who lack the conqueror’s mentality–are satisfied.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 106)\r\n> To organize our life in such a way that it becomes a mystery to others, that those who are closest to us will only be closer to not knowing us. That is how I’ve shaped my life, almost without thinking about it, but I did it with so much instinctive art that even to myself I’ve become a not entirely clear and definite individual.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 115)\r\n> In these periods of shadowy subsistence, I’m unable to think, feel or want. I can’t write more than numbers and scribbles. I don’t feel, and the death of a loved one would strike me as having happened in a foreign language. I’m helpless. It’s as if I were sleeping and my gestures, words and deliberate acts were no more than a peripheral respiration, the rhythmic instinct of some organism.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 122)\r\n> 136 The burden of feeling! The burden of having to feel!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 138)\r\n> Just as some people work because they’re bored, I sometimes write because I have nothing to say. Daydreaming, which occurs naturally to people when they’re not thinking, in me takes written form, for I know how to dream in prose. And there are many sincere feelings and much genuine emotion that I extract from not feeling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 157)\r\n> THE INN OF REASON On the road halfway between faith and criticism stands the inn of reason. Reason is faith in what can be understood without faith, but it’s still a faith, since to understand presupposes that there’s something understandable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 166)\r\n> The ordinary man, however hard his life may be, at least has the pleasure of not thinking about it. To take life as it comes, living it externally like a cat or a dog–that is how people in general live, and that is how life should be lived, if we would have the contentment of the cat or dog.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 179)\r\n> Clouds… Today I’m conscious of the sky, but there are days when I just feel it and don’t look at it, when I just live in the city and not in the world of nature that includes it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 186)\r\n> To have opinions is to sell out to yourself. To have no opinion is to exist. To have every opinion is to be a poet.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 189)\r\n> Everything breathes beyond colour and sound, in a deep and hushed sigh.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 196)\r\n> I feel and forget. A nostalgia–the same one that everyone feels for everything–invades me as if it were an opium in the cold air. I have an inner, pseudo-ecstasy that comes from seeing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 199)\r\n> To read is to dream, guided by someone else’s hand. To read carelessly and distractedly is to let go of that hand. To be only superficially learned is the best way to read well and be profound.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 199)\r\n> To die is to become completely other. That’s why suicide is a cowardice: it’s to surrender ourselves completely to life.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 203)\r\n> Chateaubriand writes of René, his personification, ‘it wearied him to be loved’–on le fatigait en l’aimant. I realized with astonishment that this experience was identical to my own, and so I couldn’t deny its validity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 203)\r\n> when what you wanted was to remain forever free–transformed into a delivery boy whose duty is to reciprocate, to have the decency not to flee, lest anyone think that you’re cavalier towards emotions and would reject the loftiest sentiment that a human soul can offer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 204)\r\n> All that remains is my feeling of gratitude towards the one who loved me. But it’s an abstract, bewildered gratitude, more intellectual than emotional. I’m sorry that I caused someone to feel sorrow; I’m sorry about that, and only about that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 204)\r\n> I’m curious about my emotions. Whereas I don’t have the least curiosity about facts, whatever they are or will yet be.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 205)\r\n> NOTES FOR A RULE OF LIFE To need to dominate others is to need others. The commander is dependent.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 205)\r\n> Virtue and sin are inevitable manifestations in organisms which, condemned to one thing or the other, serve their sentences of being good or of being bad.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 208)\r\n> The light had become an extremely sluggish yellow, a yellow that was filthy white.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 214)\r\n> The only true art is that of construction. But the present-day milieu makes it impossible for constructive qualities to appear in the human spirit. That’s why science developed. Machines are the only things today in which there’s construction; mathematical proofs are the only arguments with a chain of logic. Creativity needs a prop, the crutch of reality. Art is a science… It suffers rhythmically.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 218)\r\n> More than once, while roaming the streets in the late afternoon, I’ve been suddenly and violently struck by the bizarre presence of organization in things.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 220)\r\n> The human soul is a murky and slimy abyss, a well on the earth’s surface that’s never used. No one would love himself if he really knew himself, and without the vanity which is born of this ignorance and is the blood of the spiritual life, our souls would die of anemia.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 222)\r\n> I’ve always felt an almost physical loathing for secret things–intrigues, diplomacy, secret societies, occult sciences. What especially irks me are these last two things–the pretension certain men have that, through their understandings with Gods or Masters or Demiurges, they and they alone know the great secrets on which the world is founded.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 225)\r\n> Art consists in making others feel what we feel, in freeing them from themselves by offering them our own personality. The true substance of whatever I feel is absolutely incommunicable, and the more profoundly I feel it, the more incommunicable it is.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 227)\r\n> In me all affections take place on the surface, but sincerely. I’ve always been an actor, and in earnest. Whenever I’ve loved, I’ve pretended to love, pretending it even to myself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 234)\r\n> Art frees us, illusorily, from the squalor of being.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 251)\r\n> Money, children, lunatics ..... Wealth should never be envied except platonically. Wealth is freedom.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 271)\r\n> Towards the end of summer, when the dull sun’s heat had lost its harshness, autumn began before it was autumn, with a mild and endlessly indefinite sadness, as if the sky didn’t feel like smiling. Its blue was sometimes lighter, sometimes greener, from the lofty colour’s own lack of substance. There was a kind of forgetfulness in the subdued purple tones of the clouds. It was no longer a torpor but a tedium that filled the lonely expanses where the clouds go by.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 282)\r\n> ‘To feel is a pain in the neck.’ This offhand remark, spoken by a stranger I met in a restaurant, has been glowing ever since on the floor of my memory. The very earthiness of the language gives the sentence spice.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 288)\r\n> If only I had been the Madame of a harem! What a pity this didn’t happen to me!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 289)\r\n> I don’t dream of possessing you. Why should I? It would only debase my dream life. To possess a body is to be banal.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 304)\r\n> In this metallic age of barbarians, only a relentless cultivation of our ability to dream, to analyse and to captivate can prevent our personality from degenerating into nothing or else into a personality like all the rest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 321)\r\n> I suppose I’m what they call a decadent, one whose spirit is outwardly defined by those sad glimmers of artificial eccentricity that incarnate an anxious and artful soul in unusual words. Yes, I think that’s what I am, and that I’m absurd.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 327)\r\n> After the last rains left the sky for earth, making the sky clear and the earth a damp mirror, the brilliant clarity of life that returned with the blue on high and that rejoiced in the freshness of the water here below left its own sky in our souls, a freshness in our hearts.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 337)\r\n> He sang, in a soft and gentle voice, a song from a faraway country. The music made the strange words familiar. It sounded like the soul’s fado,* though it didn’t in the least resemble fado. Through its veiled words and human melody, the song told of things that are in the hearts of us all and that no one knows. He sang in a kind of stupor, a kind of ecstasy right there in the street, his gaze oblivious to his listeners.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 345)\r\n> I know no pleasure like that of books, and I read very little. Books are introductions to dreams, and no introductions are necessary for one who freely and naturally enters into conversation with them. I’ve never been able to lose myself in a book; as I’m reading, the commentary of my intellect or imagination has always hindered the narrative flow. After a few minutes it’s I who am writing, and what I write is nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 357)\r\n> MOONLIGHTS …damply tarnished by a lifeless brown. …on the frozen avalanche of overlapping rooftops it is a greyish white, damply tarnished by a lifeless brown.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 358)\r\n> A nothingness that breathes, a mild death from which we awaken fresh and nostalgic, a deep forgetting that massages the tissues of our soul…\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 366)\r\n> Dean Aldrich* is an example of how happiness speaks of wine: If all be true that I do think, There are five reasons we should drink; Good wine–a friend–or being dry–Or lest we should be by and by–Or any other reason why.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 367)\r\n> We are ultimately indifferent to the truth or falseness of all religions, all philosophies, and all the uselessly verifiable hypotheses we call sciences. Nor are we really concerned about the fate of so-called humanity, or about what as a whole it does or doesn’t suffer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 371)\r\n> 451 Travel? One need only exist to travel. I go from day to day, as from station to station, in the train of my body or my destiny, leaning out over the streets and squares, over people’s faces and gestures, always the same and always different, just like scenery.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 372)\r\n> only real traveller with soul that I’ve known was an office boy at another firm where I was once employed. This young fellow collected promotional brochures for cities, countries and transportation companies; he had maps that he’d torn out of journals or that he’d asked for here and there; he had illustrations of landscapes, prints of exotic costumes, and pictures of boats and ships that he’d clipped out of newspapers and magazines. He would go to travel agencies in the name of some imaginary office, or perhaps in the name of a real office, perhaps even the one where he worked, and he would ask for brochures about trips to Italy, brochures about excursions to India, brochures listing the boat connections between Portugal and Australia. He was not only the greatest–because truest–traveller I’ve known, he was also one of the happiest people I’ve had the privilege to meet. I regret not knowing what’s become of him, or rather, I pretend I should regret it;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 376)\r\n> Modern things include (1) the development of mirrors; (2) wardrobes. We evolved, body and soul, into clothed creatures.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 378)\r\n> I’d like to be in the country to be able to like being in the city. I like being in the city in any case, but I’d like it twice over if I were in the country.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 382)\r\n> Great dreams require special social circumstances. One day, when the doleful cadence of a certain passage I’d written made me excitedly think of Chateaubriand, it didn’t take me long to remember that I’m not a viscount, nor even a Breton. On another occasion, when I’d written something whose content seemed to recall Rousseau, it likewise didn’t take long for me to realize that, besides not being the noble lord of a castle, I also lack the privilege of being a wanderer from Switzerland.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 384)\r\n> Man shouldn’t be able to see his own face–there’s nothing more sinister. Nature gave him the gift of not being able to see it, and of not being able to stare into his own eyes. Only in the water of rivers and ponds could he look at his face. And the very posture he had to assume was symbolic. He had to bend over, stoop down, to commit the ignominy of beholding himself. The inventor of the mirror poisoned the human heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 386)\r\n> Even writing has lost its appeal. To express emotions in words and to produce well-wrought sentences has become so banal it’s like eating or drinking, something I do with greater or lesser interest but always with a certain detachment, and without real enthusiasm or brilliance. A Disquiet Anthology\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 399 (Location Location)\r\n> I follow wherever my dreams lead, making the images into steps that lead to other images; I unfold–like a fan–each chance metaphor into a large, inwardly visible picture; I cast off my life like a suit that’s too tight. I hide among trees, far away from the roads. I lose myself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 402 (Location Location)\r\n> Never read a book to the end, nor in sequence and without skipping.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 409 (Location Location)\r\n> We’re sympathetic towards the occult and the secret arts. We are not occultists, however. We weren’t born with the kind of will it takes, let alone the patience to educate and develop such a will into the perfect instrument of a wizard or hypnotist. But we sympathize with occultism, especially since it tends to express itself in ways that many who read and even think they understand it don’t understand a thing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 411 (Location Location)\r\n> What does anyone do that can disturb or change the world? Isn’t there always, for every man of worth, another man just as worthy?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 419 (Location Location)\r\n> The static motion of the trees; the troubled quiet of the fountains; the indefinable breathing of the saps’ deep pulsing; the slow arrival of dusk, which seems not to fall over things but to come from inside them and to reach its spiritually kindred hand up to that distant sorrow (so close to our soul) of the heavens’ lofty silence;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 424 (Location Location)\r\n> THE LAKE OF POSSESSION (II) Be it atoms or souls, nothing interpenetrates, which is why possession is impossible. From truth to a handkerchief–nothing is possessable. Property isn’t a theft: it’s nothing.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 426 (Location Location)\r\n> The logical reward of my detachment from life is the incapacity I’ve created in others to feel anything for me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](/writing/images/book_disquiet.jpeg)\r\n"

I observed, however, that these sometimes misled us; and it is the part of prudence not to place absolute confidence in that by which we have even once been deceived.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 3 (Location 154)\r\n> there exist no certain marks by which the state of waking can ever be distinguished from sleep, that I feel greatly astonished; and in amazement I almost persuade myself that I am now dreaming.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 4 (Location 171)\r\n> for whether I am awake or dreaming, it remains true that two and three make five, and that a square has but four sides; nor does it seem possible that truths so apparent can ever fall under a suspicion of falsity (or incertitude). Meditation II. Of the Nature of the Human Mind; and That it Is More Easily Known than the Body\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 7 (Location 214)\r\n> I will continue always in this track until I shall find something that is certain, or at least, if I can do nothing more, until I shall know with certainty that there is nothing certain. Bookmark - Page 7 · Location 218\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 7 (Location 220)\r\n> What is there, then, that can be esteemed true? Perhaps this only, that there is absolutely nothing certain.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location 224)\r\n> Am I so dependent on the body and the senses that without these I cannot exist?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location 227)\r\n> Doubtless, then, I exist, since I am deceived; and, let him deceive me as he may, he can never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I shall be conscious that I am something.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location 235)\r\n> What then did I formerly think I was ? Undoubtedly I judged that I was a man. But what is a man? Shall I say a rational animal ? Assuredly not; for it would be necessary forthwith to inquire into what is meant by animal, and what by rational, and thus, from a single question, I should insensibly glide into others, and these more difficult than the first;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 10 (Location 255)\r\n> Thinking is another attribute of the soul; and here I discover what properly belongs to myself. This alone is inseparable from me. I am–I exist: this is certain; but how often? As often as I think; for perhaps it would even happen, if I should wholly cease to think, that I should at the same time altogether cease to be.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 11 (Location 275)\r\n> what, then, am I ? A thinking thing, it has been said. But what is a thinking thing? It is a thing that doubts, understands, (conceives), affirms, denies, wills, refuses; that imagines also, and perceives.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 12 (Location 285)\r\n> In fine, I am the same being who perceives, that is, who apprehends certain objects as by the organs of sense, since, in truth, I see light, hear a noise, and feel heat. But it will be said that these presentations are false, and that I am dreaming. Let it be so.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 14 (Location 322)\r\n> But, meanwhile, I feel greatly astonished when I observe (the weakness of my mind, and) its proneness to error. For although, without at all giving expression to what I think, I consider all this in my own mind, words yet occasionally impede my progress, and I am almost led into error by the terms of ordinary language.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 16 (Location 343)\r\n> So likewise, if I judge that the wax exists because I touch it, it will still also follow that I am; and if I determine that my imagination, or any other cause, whatever it be, persuades me of the existence of the wax, I will still draw the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 16 (Location 350)\r\n> But, in conclusion, I find I have insensibly reverted to the point I desired; for, since it is now manifest to me that bodies themselves are not properly perceived by the senses nor by the faculty of imagination, but by the intellect alone; Meditation III. Of God: That He Exists\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 19 (Location 385)\r\n> And in truth, as I have no ground for believing that Deity is deceitful, and as, indeed, I have not even considered the reasons by which the existence of a Deity of any kind is established, the ground of doubt that rests only on this supposition is very slight, and, so to speak, metaphysical.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 26 (Location 500)\r\n> By the name God, I understand a substance infinite, (eternal, immutable), independent, all-knowing, all-powerful, and by which I myself, and every other thing that exists, if any such there be, were created.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 27 (Location 504)\r\n> For though the idea of substance be in my mind owing to this, that I myself am a substance, I should not, however, have the idea of an infinite substance, seeing I am a finite being, unless it were given me by some substance in reality infinite.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 28 (Location 517)\r\n> although I do not comprehend the infinite, and although there may be in God an infinity of things that I cannot comprehend, nor perhaps even compass by thought in any way; Meditation IV. of Truth and Error\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 37 (Location 636)\r\n> And assuredly there is no doubt that God could have created me such as that I should never be deceived; it is certain, likewise, that he always wills what is best: is it better, then, that I should be capable of being deceived than that I should not ? Meditation VI. of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction Between the Mind and Body of Man\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 61 (Location 965)\r\n> Nature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I am besides so intimately conjoined, and as it were intermixed with it, that my mind and body compose a certain unity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![descartes](/writing/images/descartes.webp)"

It does little to feed the tree, but it is the structural support. The sapwood, which feeds everything, is weak and prone to fungi and insect damage. The two look the same. But you want the heartwood. You always want the heartwood. 3\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 21 (Location 448)\r\n> I felt an inch tall because I had expected this young woman with the blue fingernails to be a certain way, to be slow and stupid, but she was neither. I was the stupid one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 25 (Location 524)\r\n> “I know who you’re talking about. That’s Tamika Jones. Tamika Jones actually has two children. The little boy with her today is named Mystery.” “Mystery?” “That’s right. And her daughter’s name is Fantasy.” “Mystery and Fantasy.” “Named after their fathers. One was a mystery and the other a fantasy.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 29 (Location 586)\r\n> The reality of popular culture was nothing new. The truth of the world landing on me daily, or hourly, was nothing I did not expect. But this book was a real slap in the face. It was like strolling through an antique mall, feeling good, liking the sunny day and then turning the corner to find a display of watermelon-eating, banjo-playing darkie carvings and a pyramid of Mammy cookie jars. 3 million dollars.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 29 (Location 594)\r\n> For a second, I thought I saw the face of the man who had been staring at us from the bar in the restaurant, but then he was gone. 4\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 30 (Location 596)\r\n> Story idea—a man marries a woman whose name is the same as that of his first wife. One night while making love he says her name and the woman accuses him of calling out the name of his first wife. Of course he in fact has called out the name of his first wife, but also he has called out his present wife’s name. He tells her that he was not thinking of his first wife, but she says she knows what she heard.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 31 (Location 613)\r\n> I looked at the calendar on the wall. It was from last year, but on the correct month. “Mother, that calendar’s out of date.” “Lisa keeps telling me that, but I can’t remember to change it.” “Tell you what, I’ll pick up a new one for you.” As I said it, I wondered what kind of grief I might cause Lisa by buying Mother a new calendar. Would the old lady go on and on about where it came from? I could imagine the months peeling by and Lisa having to endure, Would you look at that picture of the Grand Canyon. Monksie gave me that calendar. He noticed that the old one was out of date.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 32 (Location 632)\r\n> “No thanks.” I blew on the tea and drank some. “So, are you meeting with your club much these days?” “Not so much. They’re all dying off. Young women aren’t interested in bridge anymore.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 32 (Location 639)\r\n> Anyone who speaks to members of his family knows that sharing a language does not mean you share the rules governing the use of that language. No matter what is said, something else is meant and I knew that for all my mother’s seeming incoherence or out-of-itness, she was trying to tell me something over tea. The way she had mentioned the smoke in the living room twice. Her calling the blue box gray. Her easy and quick capitulation to what it was she and her cronies actually did at their meetings. But since I didn’t know the rules, which were forever changing, I could only know that she was trying to say something, not what that something was.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 32 (Location 647)\r\n> “You don’t sign it because you want people to know you painted it, but because you love it.” He was all wrong of course, but the sentiment was so beautiful that I wish to believe it now. What he might have been trying to say, I suppose, though he never would have even thought about it in these terms, was that art finds its form and that it is never a mere manifestation of life.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 39 (Location 785)\r\n> The twists and turns of the novel are fascinating, but the real strength of the work is its haunting verisimilitude. 5\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 43 (Location 836)\r\n> “They shot her.” “What?” “Dr. Lisa is dead.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 44 (Location 847)\r\n> It’s incredible that a sentence is ever understood. Mere sounds strung together by some agent attempting to mean some thing, but the meaning need not and does not confine itself to that intention.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 44 (Location 853)\r\n> A metaphor cannot be paraphrased.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 45 (Location 856)\r\n> My gym teacher, whom I imagined eating rail spikes for breakfast, was gay and I knew it not because he held his hands a certain way, not because he made a pass at me, not because he would park himself by the showers and listen to us bathe, but because I saw him late one night walking hand in hand with another man. At first I was shocked, but I caught myself. What I really felt was envy. He seemed so happy, holding his friend’s hand, enjoying the evening. I wanted to hold a hand too, albeit a girl’s hand, but a hand nonetheless.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 45 (Location 862)\r\n> My father had a term, which I heard once, for a homosexual man and that was Eye. I never did discover how the word came to mean anything.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 47 (Location 891)\r\n> C’est plus qu’un crime, c’est une faute.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 50 (Location 948)\r\n> I remembered vividly making the box and hoping the while that she would like it as much I enjoyed constructing it. I lifted the lid and looked closely at the spalted maple inlay. It had darkened with age, but was still considerably lighter than the ebony box. There was one ring in the box and I guessed it had been Lisa’s wedding ring.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 50 (Location 961)\r\n> Bill told me that he admitted to Sandy that he was gay and that she took him to court and took the kids, the house, the money, everything. He told me his practice was failing because everyone now knew he was gay.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 50 (Location 963)\r\n> He said he lived in Arizona. He said: “Sandy actually deserves everything. I lied to her for fifteen years. I endangered her life, or so she believes. The judge believed her anyway. I’ve confused my children and it will take a while for them to be able to understand what’s happened. If they ever will. I deserve what I got. Which is, basically, nothing. I can’t look my kids in the eye. I owe more money than I make. And I live in Arizona.” My Pafology\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 136 (Location 2401)\r\n> credo quia absurdum est\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 143 (Location 2545)\r\n> “What kind of doctor will I be, Father?” “A good one,” he said, as he had every other time she’d asked and it satisfied her. “And what about Bill?” I asked. To which Father replied, “I don’t know.” We ate on in silence. 9\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 160 (Location 2829)\r\n> Father had been chewing and listening to us in that absent way of his. He looked at Lisa, then me, studying us, it seemed. He looked down the table to Mother, nodding his head. Then he looked longest at Bill. He then took us in as a group, and said, “Sight” with a smile that was not quite a smile, but enough for us to laugh as if we had been teased rather than insulted. 11\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 185 (Location 3278)\r\n> Of course I felt bad for my brother and sister, but I felt worse for myself. I didn’t enjoy being so set apart and I was well aware, painfully aware, of the inappropriateness and incorrectness of Father’s assessment of me. At eighteen, I realized I was eighteen and not so smart or special, and that might have been the only way that I was in fact special. I found my own ideas poorly formed and repugnant, my self awkward and, more or less, for lack of a better word, geeky. In fact, my brother, second-year medical school student that he was, revisited his childhood and, when he passed in the hallway, muttered, “Geek.” 12\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 191 (Location 3379)\r\n> Wittgenstein: Why did Bach have to sell his organ? Derrida: I don’t know. Why? Wittgenstein: Because he was baroque. Derrida: You mean because he composed music marked by elaborate and even grotesque ornamentation? Wittgenstein: Well, no that’s not exactly what I was getting at. It was a play on words. Derrida: Oh, I get it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 193 (Location 3406)\r\n> D. W.

Pollock: No, I insist. Moore: You. Pollock: You. Moore: Very well. 15\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 227 (Location 3985)\r\n> Rauschenberg: Well, it took me forty erasers, but I did it. de Kooning: Did what? Rauschenberg: Erased it. The picture you drew for me. de Kooning: You erased my picture? Rauschenberg: Yes. de Kooning: Where is it? Rauschenberg: Your drawing is gone. What remains is my erasing and the paper which was mine to begin with. (Shows de Kooning the picture) de Kooning: You put your name on it. Rauschenberg: Why not? It’s my work. de Kooning: Your work? Look at what you’ve done to my picture. Rauschenberg: Nice job, eh? It was a lot of work erasing it. My wrist is still sore. I call it “Erased Drawing.” de Kooning: That’s very clever. Rauschenberg: I’ve already sold it for ten grand. de Kooning: You sold my picture? Rauschenberg: No, I erased your picture. I sold my erasing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 230 (Location 4030)\r\n> Linda Mallory was the postmodern fuck.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 231 (Location 4050)\r\n> Linda nestled her head onto my chest and I was saddened by the fact that I disliked the coconut fragrance of her shampoo. 17\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 248 (Location 4330)\r\n> Of course, it meant nothing and so, it meant everything. 18\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 254 (Location 4433)\r\n> There isn’t anything so bad that seeing something worse won’t make better.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](/writing/images/erasure.jpeg)\r\n"

He was wrapped up from head to foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 44 (Location undefined)\r\n> parlour and began to lay them with the utmost éclat.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 46 (Location undefined)\r\n> His gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in thought.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 49 (Location undefined)\r\n> He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. “I prefer to keep them on,” he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 55 (Location undefined)\r\n> She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to him, “Your lunch is served, sir.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 88 (Location undefined)\r\n> “And they goggles! Why, he looked more like a divin’ helmet than a human man!”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 114 (Location undefined)\r\n> But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon. CHAPTER 2 Mr. Teddy Henfrey’s First Impressions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 122 (Location undefined)\r\n> Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar. “My sakes! Mrs. Hall,” said he, “but this is terrible weather for thin boots!”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 142 (Location undefined)\r\n> “But I’m really glad to have the clock seen to,” he said, seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey’s manner. “Very glad.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 180 (Location undefined)\r\n> “Rum-looking customer stopping at the ‘Coach and Horses,’” said Teddy. “My sakes!” CHAPTER 3 The Thousand and One Bottles\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 233 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I’d shoot en, that’s what I’d do,” said a lady in the group. Suddenly the dog began growling again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 266 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I can’t go on,” he was raving. “I can’t go on. Three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand! The huge multitude! Cheated! All my life it may take me! . . . Patience! Patience indeed! . . . Fool! fool!”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 273 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I’ll tell you something,” said Fearenside, mysteriously. It was late in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping Hanger. “Well?” said Teddy Henfrey. “This chap you’re speaking of, what my dog bit. Well—he’s black. Leastways, his legs are. I seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove. You’d have expected a sort of pinky to show, wouldn’t you? Well—there wasn’t none. Just blackness. I tell you, he’s as black as my hat.” CHAPTER 4 Mr. Cuss Interviews the Stranger\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 292 (Location undefined)\r\n> Communication with the world beyond the village he had none. His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation, and once or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 303 (Location undefined)\r\n> When questioned, she explained very carefully that he was an “experimental investigator,” going gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked what an experimental investigator was, she would say with a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that he “discovered things.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 326 (Location undefined)\r\n> Also belated little children would call “Bogey Man!” after him, and make off tremulously elated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 334 (Location undefined)\r\n> Cuss appeared, his face white, his eyes staring over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 358 (Location undefined)\r\n> “That’s all. He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve back in his pocket quickly. ‘I was saying,’ said he, ‘that there was the prescription burning, wasn’t I?’ Interrogative cough. ‘How the devil,’ said I, ‘can you move an empty sleeve like that?’ ‘Empty sleeve?’ ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘an empty sleeve.’ “‘ It’s an empty sleeve, is it? You saw it was an empty sleeve?’ He stood up right away. I stood up too. He came towards me in three very slow steps, and stood quite close. Sniffed venomously. I didn’t flinch, though I’m hanged if that bandaged knob of his, and those blinkers, aren’t enough to unnerve anyone, coming quietly up to you. “‘ You said it was an empty sleeve?’ he said. ‘Certainly,’ I said. At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man, unspectacled, starts scratch. Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an age. ‘Well?’ said I, clearing my throat, ‘there’s nothing in it.’\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 374 (Location undefined)\r\n> Mr. Bunting thought it over. He looked suspiciously at Cuss. “It’s a most remarkable story,” he said. He looked very wise and grave indeed. “It’s really,” said Mr. Bunting with judicial emphasis, “a most remarkable story.” CHAPTER 5 The Burglary at the Vicarage\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 388 (Location undefined)\r\n> Then came an imprecation, and a match was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light. Mr. Bunting was now in the hall, and through the crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk. But the robber he could not see. CHAPTER 6 The Furniture That Went Mad Bookmark - Location 412\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 413 (Location undefined)\r\n> Mr. Hall and Mrs. Hall both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar. Their business there was of a private nature, and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer. They had hardly entered the cellar when Mrs. Hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room. As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair, Hall very properly went upstairs for it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 458 (Location undefined)\r\n> The Anglo-Saxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action. CHAPTER 7 The Unveiling of the Stranger\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 487 (Location undefined)\r\n> And inside, in the artificial darkness of the parlour, into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated, the stranger, hungry we must suppose, and fearful, hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings, pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles, and occasionally swore savagely at the boys, audible if invisible, outside the windows.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 514 (Location undefined)\r\n> “You don’t understand,” he said, “who I am or what I am. I’ll show you. By Heaven! I’ll show you.” Then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it. The centre of his face became a black cavity. “Here,” he said. He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she, staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically. Then, when she saw what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and staggered back. The nose—it was the stranger’s nose! pink and shining—rolled on the floor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 549 (Location undefined)\r\n> In another moment Jaffers, cutting short some statement concerning a warrant, had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 557 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I’ll surrender,” cried the stranger, though he had Jaffers down, and in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure, headless and handless—for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left. “It’s no good,” he said, as if sobbing for breath.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 567 (Location undefined)\r\n> “The fact is, I’m all here—head, hands, legs, and all the rest of it, but it happens I’m invisible. It’s a confounded nuisance, but I am. That’s no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping, is it?” Bookmark - Location 596 CHAPTER 8 In Transit\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 602 (Location undefined)\r\n> CHAPTER 8 In Transit The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbons, the amateur naturalist of the district, while lying out on the spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him, as he thought, and almost dozing, heard close to him the sound as of a man coughing, sneezing, and then swearing savagely to himself; and looking, beheld nothing. Yet the voice was indisputable. It continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man. It grew to a climax, diminished again, and died away in the distance, going as it seemed to him in the direction of Adderdean. It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended. Gibbons had heard nothing of the morning’s occurrences, but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished; he got up hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village, as fast as he could go. CHAPTER 9 Mr. Thomas Marvel\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 612 (Location undefined)\r\n> Mr. Thomas Marvel as a person of copious, flexible visage, a nose of cylindrical protrusion, a liquorish, ample, fluctuating mouth, and a beard of bristling eccentricity. His figure inclined to embonpoint; his short limbs accentuated this inclination. He wore a furry silk hat, and the frequent substitution of twine and shoe-laces for buttons, apparent at critical points of his costume, marked a man essentially bachelor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 654 (Location undefined)\r\n> “You think I’m just imagination? Just imagination?” “What else can you be?” said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the back of his neck. “Very well,” said the Voice, in a tone of relief. “Then I’m going to throw flints at you till you think differently.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 677 (Location undefined)\r\n> “Let’s have a hand of you,” said Marvel, “if you are real. It won’t be so darn out-of-the-way like, then—Lord!” he said, “how you made me jump!—gripping me like that!”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 685 (Location undefined)\r\n> “Of course, all this isn’t half so wonderful as you think.” “It’s quite wonderful enough for my modest wants,” said Mr. Thomas Marvel. “Howjer manage it! How the dooce is it done?”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 699 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I’ve chosen you,” said the Voice. “You are the only man except some of those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man. You have to be my helper. Help me—and I will do great things for you. An invisible man is a man of power.” He stopped for a moment to sneeze violently. CHAPTER 10 Mr. Marvel’s Visit to Iping\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 711 (Location undefined)\r\n> Great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller, more tangible considerations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 713 (Location undefined)\r\n> By the afternoon even those who believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion, on the supposition that he had quite gone away, and with the sceptics he was already a jest. But people, sceptics and believers alike, were remarkably sociable all that day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 739 (Location undefined)\r\n> Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket. Then he vanished into the yard.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 747 (Location undefined)\r\n> The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceedings interested him no more. CHAPTER 11 In the “Coach and Horses”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 771 (Location undefined)\r\n> “All right,” said the intruder, as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry. “Right you are,” said the intruder in the former voice. “Stand clear!” and he vanished and closed the door. CHAPTER 12 The Invisible Man Loses His Temper\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 840 (Location undefined)\r\n> Mr. Huxter was stunned. Henfrey stopped to discover this, but Hall and the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner, shouting incoherent things, and saw Mr. Marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall. CHAPTER 14 At Port Stowe\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1014 (Location undefined)\r\n> It was ten days after—and indeed only when the Burdock story was already old—that the mariner collated these facts and began to understand how near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man. CHAPTER 17 Dr. Kemp’s Visitor\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1161 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I am Griffin, of University College, and I have made myself invisible. I am just an ordinary man—a man you have known—made invisible.” CHAPTER 19 Certain First Principles\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1300 (Location undefined)\r\n> “It’s simple enough—and credible enough,” said Griffin, putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1308 (Location undefined)\r\n> “But I went to work—like a slave.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1333 (Location undefined)\r\n> “You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the same refractive index; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1337 (Location undefined)\r\n> “Yes, yes,” said Kemp. “But a man’s not powdered glass!” “No,” said Griffin. “He’s more transparent!”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1363 (Location undefined)\r\n> The infinite details! And the exasperation! A professor, a provincial professor, always prying. ‘When are you going to publish this work of yours?’\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1367 (Location undefined)\r\n> He turned around abruptly. “I robbed the old man—robbed my father. “The money was not his, and he shot himself.” CHAPTER 20 At the House in Great Portland Street\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1470 (Location undefined)\r\n> I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I chloroformed it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1471 (Location undefined)\r\n> But I stuck to it. . . . I became insensible and woke languid in the darkness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1472 (Location undefined)\r\n> “The pain had passed. I thought I was killing myself and I did not care. I shall never forget that dawn, and the strange horror of seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass, and watching them grow clearer and thinner as the day went by, until at last I could see the sickly disorder of my room through them, though I closed my transparent eyelids.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1497 (Location undefined)\r\n> “The old man, so far as I could understand his patois, agreed with the old lady that I was a vivisectionist. The sons protested in garbled English that I was an electrician, and appealed to the dynamos and radiators.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1508 (Location undefined)\r\n> “You fired the house!” exclaimed Kemp. “Fired the house. It was the only way to cover my trail—and no doubt it was insured. I slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went out into the street. I was invisible, and I was only just beginning to realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me. My head was already teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things I had now impunity to do.” CHAPTER 21 In Oxford Street\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1542 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I had never realised it before, but the nose is to the mind of a dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man. Dogs perceive the scent of a man moving as men perceive his vision.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1579 (Location undefined)\r\n> It was my lodging burning; my clothes, my apparatus, all my resources indeed, except my cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great Portland Street, were there. Burning! I had burnt my boats—if ever a man did! The place was blazing.” The Invisible Man paused and thought. Kemp glanced nervously out of the window. “Yes?” he said. “Go on.” CHAPTER 23 In Drury Lane\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1672 (Location undefined)\r\n> “But you begin now to realise,” said the Invisible Man, “the full disadvantage of my condition. I had no shelter—no covering—to get clothing was to forego all my advantage, to make myself a strange and terrible thing. I was fasting; for to eat, to fill myself with unassimilated matter, would be to become grotesquely visible again.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1738 (Location undefined)\r\n> so I made no more ado, but knocked him on the head.” “Knocked him on the head?” exclaimed Kemp. “Yes—stunned him—as he was going downstairs. Hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing. He went downstairs like a bag of old boots.” “But—I say! The common conventions of humanity—” “Are all very well for common people. But the point was, Kemp, that I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me. I couldn’t think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1790 (Location undefined)\r\n> I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable. No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1805 (Location undefined)\r\n> “By Heaven, Kemp, you don’t know what rage is! . . . To have worked for years, to have planned and plotted, and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course! . . . Every conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me. CHAPTER 24 The Plan That Failed\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1833 (Location undefined)\r\n> “I made a mistake, Kemp, a huge mistake, in carrying this thing through alone. I have wasted strength, time, opportunities. Alone—it is wonderful how little a man can do alone! To rob a little, to hurt a little, and there is the end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1835 (Location undefined)\r\n> “What I want, Kemp, is a goal-keeper, a helper, and a hiding-place, an arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace, and unsuspected. I must have a confederate. With a confederate, with food and rest—a thousand things are possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1846 (Location undefined)\r\n> A Reign of Terror. He must take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it. He must issue his orders. He can do that in a thousand ways—scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice. And all who disobey his orders he must kill, and kill all who would defend them.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1852 (Location undefined)\r\n> Why dream of playing a game against the race? How can you hope to gain happiness? Don’t be a lone wolf. Publish your results; take the world—take the nation at least—into your confidence. Think what you might do with a million helpers—” CHAPTER 25 The Hunting of the Invisible Man\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1878 (Location undefined)\r\n> “He is mad,” said Kemp; “inhuman. He is pure selfishness. He thinks of nothing but his own advantage, his own safety. I have listened to such a story this morning of brutal self-seeking. . . . He has wounded men. He will kill them unless we can prevent him. He will create a panic. Nothing can stop him. He is going out now—furious!”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1902 (Location undefined)\r\n> “Powdered glass,” said Kemp. “It’s cruel, I know. But think of what he may do!” Adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth. “It’s unsportsmanlike. I don’t know. But I’ll have powdered glass got ready. If he goes too far. . . .” CHAPTER 26 The Wicksteed Murder\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1970 (Location undefined)\r\n> In the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in the morning he was himself again, active, powerful, angry, and malignant, prepared for his last great struggle against the world. CHAPTER 27 The Siege of Kemp’s House\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1994 (Location undefined)\r\n> “He must get food every day—and I don’t envy him. Did he really sleep last night? Out in the open somewhere—secure from collisions. I wish we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat. CHAPTER 28 The Hunter Hunted\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 2190 (Location undefined)\r\n> When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay, naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a young man about thirty. His hair and brow were white—not grey with age, but white with the whiteness of albinism—and his eyes were like garnets. His hands were clenched, his eyes wide open, and his expression was one of anger and dismay. THE EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 2199 (Location undefined)\r\n> So ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the Invisible Man. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 2222 (Location undefined)\r\n> Presently he relaxes and leans back, and blinks through his smoke across the room at things invisible to other eyes. “Full of secrets,” he says. “Wonderful secrets!” “Once I get the haul of them—Lord!” “I wouldn’t do what he did; I’d just—well!” He pulls at his pipe. So he lapses into a dream, the undying wonderful dream of his life. And though Kemp has fished unceasingly, no human being save the landlord knows those books are there, with the subtle secret of invisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein. And none other will know of them until he dies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](/writing/images/invisible_man.jpeg)"

CHAPTER 2\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 11 (Location Location)\r\n> IMAGINATION therefore is nothing but decaying sense; and is found in men, and many other living Creatures, as well sleeping, as waking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 11 (Location Location)\r\n> The decay of Sense in men waking, is not the decay of the motion made in sense; but an obscuring of it, in such manner, as the light of the Sun obscureth the light of the Starres; which starrs do no less exercise their vertue by which they are visible, in the day, than in the night. CHAPTER 10\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 76 (Location Location)\r\n> Power The POWER of a Man, (to take it Universally,) is his present means, to obtain some future apparent Good. And is either Originall, or Instrumentall. Naturall Power, is the eminence of the Faculties of Body, or Mind: as extraordinary Strength, Forme, Prudence, Arts, Eloquence, Liberality, Nobility. Instrumentall are those Powers, which acquired by these, or by fortune, are means and Instruments to acquire more: as Riches, Reputation, Friends, and the Secret working of God, which men call Good Luck. For the nature of Power, is in this point, like to Fame, increasing as it proceeds; or like the motion of heavy bodies, which the further they go, make still the more hast. The Greatest of humane Powers, is that which is compounded of the Powers of most men, united by consent, in one person, Naturall, or civill, that has the use of all their Powers depending on his will; such as is the Power of a Common-wealth: or depending on the wills of each particular; such as is the Power of a Faction, or of divers factions leagued. Therefore to have servants, is Power; To have Friends, is Power: for they are strengths united. Also Riches joined with liberality, is Power; because it procureth friends, and servants: Without liberality, not so; because in this case they defend not; but expose men to Envy, as a Prey. Reputation of power, is Power; because it draweth with it the adhaerance of those that need protection. So is Reputation of love of a man’s Country, (called Popularity,) for the same Reason. Also, what quality soever maketh a man beloved, or feared of many; or the reputation of such quality, is Power; because it is a means to have the assistance, and service of many. Good successe is Power; because it maketh reputation of Wisdome, or good fortune; which makes men either feare him, or rely on him. Affability of men already in power, is encrease of Power; because it gaineth love. Reputation of Prudence in the conduct of Peace or War, is Power; because to prudent men, we commit the government of our selves, more willingly than to others. Nobility is Power, not in all places, but onely in those Common-wealths, where it has Priviledges: for in such priviledges consisteth their Power. Eloquence is Power; because it is seeming Prudence. Forme is Power; because being a promise of Good, it recommendeth men to the favour of women and strangers. The Sciences, are small Power; because not eminent; and therefore, not acknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but in a few; and in them, but of a few things. For Science is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such as in a good measure have attayned it. Arts of publique use, as Fortification, making of Engines, and other Instruments of War; because they conferre to Defence, and Victory, are Power; And though the true Mother of them, be Science, namely the Mathematiques; yet, because they are brought into the Light, by the hand of the Artificer, they be esteemed (the Midwife passing with the vulgar for the Mother,) as his issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 78 (Location Location)\r\n> Worth The Value, or WORTH of a man, is as of all other things, his Price; that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of his Power: and therefore is not absolute; but a thing dependant on the need and judgment of another. An able conductor of Souldiers, is of great Price in time of War present, or imminent; but in Peace not so. A learned and uncorrupt Judge, is much Worth in time of Peace; but not so much in War. And as in other things, so in men, not the seller, but the buyer determines the Price. For let a man (as most men do,) rate themselves as the highest Value they can; yet their true Value is no more than it is esteemed by others. The manifestation of the Value we set on one another, is that which is commonly called Honouring, and Dishonouring. To Value a man at a high rate, is to Honour him; at a low rate, is to Dishonour him. But high, and low, in this case, is to be understood by comparison to the rate that each man setteth on himself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 78 (Location Location)\r\n> Dignity The publique worth of a man, which is the Value set on him by the Common-wealth, is that which men commonly call DIGNITY. And this Value of him by the Common-wealth, is understood, by offices of Command, Judicature, publike Employment; or by Names and Titles, introduced for distinction of such Value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 79 (Location Location)\r\n> To Honour and Dishonour To pray to another, for ayde of any kind, is to HONOUR; because a signe we have an opinion he has power to help; and the more difficult the ayde is, the more is the Honour. To obey, is to Honour; because no man obeyes them, whom they think have no power to help, or hurt them. And consequently to disobey, is to Dishonour. To give great gifts to a man, is to Honour him; because ’tis buying of Protection, and acknowledging of Power. To give little gifts, is to Dishonour; because it is but Almes, and signifies an opinion of the need of small helps. To be sedulous in promoting anothers good; also to flatter, is to Honour; as a signe we seek his protection or ayde. To neglect, is to Dishonour. To give way, or place to another, in any Commodity, is to Honour; being a confession of greater power. To arrogate, is to Dishonour. To shew any signe of love, or feare of another, is to Honour; for both to love, and to feare, is to value. To contemne, or lesse to love or feare then he expects, is to Dishonour; for ’tis undervaluing. To praise, magnifie, or call happy, is to Honour; because nothing but goodnesse, power, and felicity is valued. To revile, mock, or pitty, is to Dishonour. To speak to another with consideration, to appear before him with decency, and humility, is to Honour him; as signes of fear to offend. To speak to him rashly, to do anything before him obscenely, slovenly, impudently, is to Dishonour. To believe, to trust, to rely on another, is to Honour him; signe of opinion of his vertue and power. To distrust, or not believe, is to Dishonour. To hearken to a man’s counsell, or discourse of what kind soever, is to Honour; as a signe we think him wise, or eloquent, or witty. To sleep, or go forth, or talk the while, is to Dishonour. To do those things to another, which he takes for signes of Honour, or which the Law or Custome makes so, is to Honour; because in approving the Honour done by others, he acknowledgeth the power which others acknowledge. To refuse to do them, is to Dishonour. To agree with in opinion, is to Honour; as being a signe of approving his judgment, and wisdome. To dissent, is Dishonour; and an upbraiding of errour; and (if the dissent be in many things) of folly. To imitate, is to Honour; for it is vehemently to approve. To imitate ones Enemy, is to Dishonour. To honour those another honours, is to Honour him; as a signe of approbation of his judgment. To honour his Enemies, is to Dishonour him. To employ in counsell, or in actions of difficulty, is to Honour; as a signe of opinion of his wisdome, or other power. To deny employment in the same cases, to those that seek it, is to Dishonour. All these wayes of Honouring, are naturall; and as well within, as without Common-wealths. But in Common-wealths, where he, or they that have the supreme Authority, can make whatsoever they please, to stand for signes of Honour, there be other Honours. A Soveraigne doth Honour a Subject, with whatsoever Title, or Office, or Employment, or Action, that he himself will have taken for a signe of his will to Honour him. The King of Persia, Honoured Mordecay, when he appointed he should be conducted through the streets in the Kings Garment, upon one of the Kings Horses, with a Crown on his head, and a Prince before him, proclayming, Thus shall it be done to him that the King will honour. And yet another King of Persia, or the same another time, to one that demanded for some great service, to weare one of the Kings robes, gave him leave so to do; but with his addition, that he should weare it as the Kings foole; and then it was Dishonour. So that of Civill Honour; such as are Magistracy, Offices, Titles; and in some places Coats, and Scutchions painted: and men Honour such as have them, as having so many signes of favour in the Common-wealth; which favour is Power.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 81 (Location Location)\r\n> Honourable; Dishonourable Honourable is whatsoever possession, action, or quality, is an argument and signe of Power. And therefore To be Honoured, loved, or feared of many, is Honourable; as arguments of Power. To be Honoured of few or none, Dishonourable. Dominion, and Victory is Honourable; because acquired by Power; and Servitude, for need, or feare, is Dishonourable. Good fortune (if lasting,) Honourable; as a signe of the favour of God. Ill fortune, and losses, Dishonourable. Riches, are Honourable; for they are Power. Poverty, Dishonourable. Magnanimity, Liberality, Hope, Courage, Confidence, are Honourable; for they proceed from the conscience of Power. Pusillanimity, Parsimony, Fear, Diffidence, are Dishonourable. Timely Resolution, or determination of what a man is to do, is Honourable; as being the contempt of small difficulties, and dangers. And Irresolution, Dishonourable; as a signe of too much valuing of little impediments, and little advantages: For when a man has weighed things as long as the time permits, and resolves not, the difference of weight is but little; and therefore if he resolve not, he overvalues little things, which is Pusillanimity. All Actions, and Speeches, that proceed, or seem to proceed from much Experience, Science, Discretion, or Wit, are Honourable; For all these are Powers. Actions, or Words that proceed from Errour, Ignorance, or Folly, Dishonourable. Gravity, as farre forth as it seems to proceed from a mind employed on some thing else, is Honourable; because employment is a signe of Power. But if it seem to proceed from a purpose to appear grave, it is Dishonourable. For the gravity of the Former, is like the steddinesse of a Ship laden with Merchandise; but of the later, like the steddinesse of a Ship ballasted with Sand, and other trash. To be Conspicuous, that is to say, to be known, for Wealth, Office, great Actions, or any eminent Good, is Honourable; as a signe of the power for which he is conspicuous. On the contrary, Obscurity, is Dishonourable. To be descended from conspicuous Parents, is Honourable; because they the more easily attain the aydes, and friends of their Ancestors. On the contrary, to be descended from obscure Parentage, is Dishonourable. Actions proceeding from Equity, joined with losse, are Honourable; as signes of Magnanimity: for Magnanimity is a signe of Power. On the contrary, Craft, Shifting, neglect of Equity, is Dishonourable. Covetousnesse of great Riches, and ambition of great Honours, are Honourable; as signes of power to obtain them. Covetousnesse, and ambition, of little gaines, or preferments, is Dishonourable. Nor does it alter the case of Honour, whether an action (so it be great and difficult, and consequently a signe of much power,) be just or unjust: for Honour consisteth onely in the opinion of Power. Therefore the ancient Heathen did not thinke they Dishonoured, but greatly Honoured the Gods, when they introduced them in their Poems, committing Rapes, Thefts, and other great, but unjust, or unclean acts: In so much as nothing is so much celebrated in Jupiter, as his Adulteries; nor in Mercury, as his Frauds, and Thefts: of whose praises, in a hymne of Homer, the greatest is this, that being born in the morning, he had invented Musique at noon, and before night, stolen away the Cattell of Apollo, from his Herdsmen. Also amongst men, till there were constituted great Common-wealths, it was thought no dishonour to be a Pyrate, or a High-way Theefe; but rather a lawfull Trade, not onely amongst the Greeks, but also amongst all other Nations; as is manifest by the Histories of ancient time. And at this day, in this part of the world, private Duels are, and alwayes will be Honourable, though unlawfull, till such time as there shall be Honour ordained for them that refuse, and Ignominy for them that make the Challenge. For Duels also are many times effects of Courage; and the ground of Courage is alwayes Strength or Skill, which are Power; though for the most part they be effects of rash speaking, and of the fear of Dishonour, in one, or both the Combatants; who engaged by rashnesse, are driven into the Lists to avoid disgrace.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 83 (Location Location)\r\n> Coats of Armes Scutchions, and coats of Armes haereditary, where they have any eminent Priviledges, are Honourable; otherwise not: for their Power consisteth either in such Priviledges, or in Riches, or some such thing as is equally honoured in other men. This kind of Honour, commonly called Gentry, has been derived from the Ancient Germans. For there never was any such thing known, where the German Customes were unknown. Nor is it now any where in use, where the Germans have not inhabited. The ancient Greek Commanders, when they went to war, had their Shields painted with such Devises as they pleased; insomuch as an unpainted Buckler was a signe of Poverty, and of a common Souldier: but they transmitted not the Inheritance of them. The Romans transmitted the Marks of their Families: but they were the Images, not the Devises of their Ancestors. Amongst the people of Asia, Afrique, and America, there is not, nor was ever, any such thing. The Germans onely had that custome; from whom it has been derived into England, France, Spain, and Italy, when in great numbers they either ayded the Romans, or made their own Conquests in these Westerne parts of the world. For Germany, being antiently, as all other Countries, in their beginnings, divided amongst an infinite number of little Lords, or Masters of Families, that continually had wars one with another; those Masters, or Lords, principally to the end they might, when they were Covered with Arms, be known by their followers; and partly for ornament, both painted their Armor, or their Scutchion, or Coat, with the picture of some Beast, or other thing; and also put some eminent and visible mark upon the Crest of their Helmets. And his ornament both of the Armes, and Crest, descended by inheritance to their Children; to the eldest pure, and to the rest with some note of diversity, such as the Old master, that is to say in Dutch, the Here-alt thought fit. But when many such Families, joined together, made a greater Monarchy, this duty of the Herealt, to distinguish Scutchions, was made a private Office a part. And the issue of these Lords, is the great and ancient Gentry; which for the most part bear living creatures, noted for courage, and rapine; or Castles, Battlements, Belts, Weapons, Bars, Palisadoes, and other notes of War; nothing being then in honour, but vertue military. Afterwards, not onely Kings, but popular Common-wealths, gave divers manners of Scutchions, to such as went forth to the War, or returned from it, for encouragement, or recompence to their service. All which, by an observing Reader, may be found in such ancient Histories, Greek and Latine, as make mention of the German Nation, and Manners, in their times.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 84 (Location Location)\r\n> Titles of Honour Titles of Honour, such as are Duke, Count, Marquis, and Baron, are Honourable; as signifying the value set upon them by the Soveraigne Power of the Common-wealth: Which Titles, were in old time titles of Office, and Command, derived some from the Romans, some from the Germans, and French. Dukes, in Latine Duces, being Generalls in War: Counts, Comites, such as bare the Generall company out of friendship; and were left to govern and defend places conquered, and pacified: Marquises, Marchiones, were Counts that governed the Marches, or bounds of the Empire. Which titles of Duke, Count, and Marquis, came into the Empire, about the time of Constantine the Great, from the customes of the German Militia. But Baron, seems to have been a Title of the Gaules, and signifies a Great man; such as were the Kings, or Princes men, whom they employed in war about their persons; and seems to be derived from Vir, to Ber, and Bar, that signified the same in the Language of the Gaules, that Vir in Latine; and thence to Bero, and Baro: so that such men were called Berones, and after Barones; and (in Spanish) Varones. But he that would know more particularly the originall of Titles of Honour, may find it, as I have done this, in Mr. Seldens most excellent Treatise of that subject. In processe of time these offices of Honour, by occasion of trouble, and for reasons of good and peacable government, were turned into meer Titles; serving for the most part, to distinguish the precedence, place, and order of subjects in the Common-wealth: and men were made Dukes, Counts, Marquises, and Barons of Places, wherein they had neither possession, nor command: and other Titles also, were devised to the same end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 85 (Location Location)\r\n> Worthinesse; Fitnesse WORTHINESSE, is a thing different from the worth, or value of a man; and also from his merit, or desert; and consisteth in a particular power, or ability for that, whereof he is said to be worthy: which particular ability, is usually named FITNESSE, or Aptitude. For he is Worthiest to be a Commander, to be a Judge, or to have any other charge, that is best fitted, with the qualities required to the well discharging of it; and Worthiest of Riches, that has the qualities most requisite for the well using of them: any of which qualities being absent, one may neverthelesse be a Worthy man, and valuable for some thing else. Again, a man may be Worthy of Riches, Office, and Employment, that neverthelesse, can plead no right to have it before another; and therefore cannot be said to merit or deserve it. For Merit, praesupposeth a right, and that the thing deserved is due by promise: Of which I shall say more hereafter, when I shall speak of Contracts. CHAPTER 11\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 86 (Location Location)\r\n> By MANNERS, I mean not here, Decency of behaviour; as how one man should salute another, or how a man should wash his mouth, or pick his teeth before company, and such other points of the Small Moralls; But those qualities of mankind, that concern their living together in Peace, and Unity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 91 (Location Location)\r\n> Eloquence, with flattery, disposeth men to confide in them that have it; because the former is seeming Wisdome, the later seeming Kindnesse. Adde to them Military reputation, and it disposeth men to adhaere, and subject themselves to those men that have them. The two former, having given them caution against danger from him; the later gives them caution against danger from others. CHAPTER 12\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 102 (Location Location)\r\n> And to the Worship, which naturally men conceived fit to be used towards their Gods, namely Oblations, Prayers, Thanks, and the rest formerly named; the same Legislators of the Gentiles have added their Images, both in Picture, and Sculpture; that the more ignorant sort, (that is to say, the most part, or generality of the people,) thinking the Gods for whose representation they were made, were really included, and as it were housed within them, might so much the more stand in feare of them: And endowed them with lands, and houses, and officers, and revenues, set apart from all other humane uses; that is, consecrated, and made holy to those their Idols; as Caverns, Groves, Woods, Mountains, and whole Ilands; and have attributed to them, not onely the shapes, some of Men, some of Beasts, some of Monsters; but also the Faculties, and Passions of men and beasts; as Sense, Speech, Sex, Lust, Generation, (and this not onely by mixing one with another, to propagate the kind of Gods; but also by mixing with men, and women, to beget mongrill Gods, and but inmates of Heaven, as Bacchus, Hercules, and others;) besides, Anger, Revenge, and other passions of living creatures, and the actions proceeding from them, as Fraud, Theft, Adultery, Sodomie, and any vice that may be taken for an effect of Power, or a cause of Pleasure; and all such Vices, as amongst men are taken to be against Law, rather than against Honour. CHAPTER 13\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 111 (Location Location)\r\n> Nature hath made men so equall, in the faculties of body, and mind; as that though there be found one man sometimes manifestly stronger in body, or of quicker mind then another; yet when all is reckoned together, the difference between man, and man, is not so considerable, as that one man can thereupon claim to himself any benefit, to which another may not pretend, as well as he. For as to the strength of body, the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret machination, or by confederacy with others, that are in the same danger with himself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 113 (Location Location)\r\n> So that in the nature of man, we find three principall causes of quarrel. First, Competition; Secondly, Diffidence; Thirdly, Glory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 113 (Location Location)\r\n> Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 114 (Location Location)\r\n> In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 116 (Location Location)\r\n> The Passions that encline men to Peace, are Feare of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them. CHAPTER 14\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 117 (Location Location)\r\n> The RIGHT OF NATURE, which Writers commonly call Jus Naturale, is the Liberty each man hath, to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life; and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own Judgment, and Reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 119 (Location Location)\r\n> That a man be willing, when others are so too, as farre-forth, as for Peace, and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself. CHAPTER 21\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 200 (Location Location)\r\n> As when Jeptha caused his daughter to be sacrificed: In which, and the like cases, he that so dieth, had Liberty to doe the action, for which he is neverthelesse, without Injury put to death. And the same holdeth also in a Soveraign Prince, that putteth to death an Innocent Subject. For though the action be against the law of Nature, as being contrary to Equitie, (as was the killing of Uriah, by David;) yet it was not an Injurie to Uriah; but to God.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 201 (Location Location)\r\n> Which distinction, David himself, when he repented the fact, evidently confirmed, saying, To thee only have I sinned. In the same manner, the people of Athens, when they banished the most potent of their Common-wealth for ten years, thought they committed no Injustice; and yet they never questioned what crime he had done; but what hurt he would doe: CHAPTER 34\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 380 (Location Location)\r\n> Though we find in Daniel two names of Angels, Gabriel, and Michael; yet is cleer out of the text it self, (Dan. 12.1.) that by Michael is meant Christ, not as an Angel, but as a Prince: and that Gabriel (as the like apparitions made to other holy men in their sleep) was nothing but a supernaturall phantasme, by which it seemed to Daniel, in his dream, that two Saints being in talke, one of them said to the other, Gabriel, let us make this man understand his Vision: For God needeth not, to distinguish his Celestiall servants by names, which are usefull onely to the short memories of Mortalls. CHAPTER 44\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 576 (Location Location)\r\n> Which is not arguing from Scripture, but a wanton insulting over Princes, that came in fashion after the time the Popes were growne so secure of their greatnesse, as to contemne all Christian Kings; and Treading on the necks of Emperours, to mocke both them, and the Scripture, in the words of the 91. Psalm, Thou shalt Tread upon the Lion and the Adder, the young Lion and the Dragon thou shalt Trample under thy feet.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 577 (Location Location)\r\n> And first there are the words of Solomon (Ecclesiastes 12.7.) Then shall the Dust return to Dust, as it was, and the Spirit shall return to God that gave it. Which may bear well enough (if there be no other text directly against it) this interpretation, that God onely knows, (but Man not,) what becomes of a man’s spirit, when he expireth; CHAPTER 45\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 591 (Location Location)\r\n> What were the Daemons of the Ancients What kind of things they were, to whom they attributed the name of Daemons, appeareth partly in the Genealogie of their Gods, written by Hesiod, one of the most ancient Poets of the Graecians; and partly in other Histories; of which I have observed some few before, in the 12. Chapter of this discourse.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](/writing/images/leviathan.jpg)"

Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 7 (Location Location)\r\n> Moreover, nothing is good but virtue, and nothing but vice is bad. Those outside things which are commonly called good or bad, such as health and sickness, wealth and poverty, pleasure and pain, are to him indifferent (adiofora).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location Location)\r\n> Two points in the Stoic system deserve special mention. One is a careful distinction between things which are in our power and things which are not. Desire and dislike, opinion and affection, are within the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, honour, and other such are generally not so. The Stoic was called upon to control his desires and affections, and to guide his opinion; to bring his whole being under the sway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and governed by divine Providence.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 9 (Location Location)\r\n> To this end there must be continual self-examination. “If thou may not continually gather thyself together, namely sometimes do it, at least once a day, the morning or the evening. In the morning purpose, in the evening discuss the manner, what thou hast been this day, in word, work, and thought.” THE following is...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 15 (Location Location)\r\n> THE following is a list of the chief English translations of Marcus Aurelius: (1) By Meric Casaubon, 1634; (2) Jeremy Collier, 1701; (3) James Thomson, 1747; (4) R. Graves, 1792; (5) H. McCormac, 1844; (6) George Long, 1862; (7) G. H. Rendall, 1898; and (8) J. Jackson, 1906. Renan’s “Marc-Aurèle”—the seventh volume in his “History of the Origins of Christianity,” which appeared in 1882—is the most vital and original book to be had relating to the time of Marcus Aurelius. Pater’s “Marius the Epicurean” forms another outside commentary, which is of service in the imaginative attempt to create again the period. THE FIRST BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 19 (Location Location)\r\n> Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 19 (Location Location)\r\n> From the fame and memory of him that begot me I have learned both shamefastness and manlike behaviour.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 19 (Location Location)\r\n> Of my mother I have learned to be religious, and bountiful; and to forbear, not only to do, but to intend any evil; to content myself with a spare diet, and to fly all such excess as is incidental to great wealth.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 19 (Location Location)\r\n> Of my great-grandfather, both to frequent public schools and auditories, and to get me good and able teachers at home; and that I ought not to think much, if upon such occasions, I were at excessive charges. THE SECOND BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 32 (Location Location)\r\n> Every man’s happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men. THE FOURTH BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 52 (Location Location)\r\n> Let opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged. If no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such thing as wrong. THE FIFTH BOOK Bookmark - Page 65 · Location 832\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 65 (Location Location)\r\n> It must needs be therefore, that thou dost not love thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst also love thy nature, and that which thy nature doth propose unto herself as her end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 76 (Location Location)\r\n> 21. To live with the Gods. He liveth with the Gods, who at all times affords unto them the spectacle of a soul, both contented and well pleased with whatsoever is afforded, or allotted unto her; and performing whatsoever is pleasing to that Spirit, whom (being part of himself) Jove hath appointed to every man as his overseer and governor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 77 (Location Location)\r\n> 25. How hast thou carried thyself hitherto towards the Gods? Towards thy parents? towards thy brethren? towards thy wife? towards thy children? towards thy masters? thy foster-fathers? thy friends? thy domestics? thy servants?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 78 (Location Location)\r\n> 27. Within a very little while, thou wilt be either ashes, or a sceletum; and a name perchance; and perchance, not so much as a name. And what is that but an empty sound, and a rebounding echo?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 79 (Location Location)\r\n> 30. Let death surprise rue when it will, and where it will, I may be a happy man, nevertheless. For he is a happy man, who in his lifetime dealeth unto himself a happy lot and portion. A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the soul, good desires, good actions. THE SIXTH BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 81 (Location Location)\r\n> 4. All substances come soon to their change, and either they shall be resolved by way of exhalation (if so be that all things shall be reunited into one substance), or as others maintain, they shall be scattered and dispersed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 84 (Location Location)\r\n> 14. Some things hasten to be, and others to be no more.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 87 (Location Location)\r\n> 21. I for my part will do what belongs unto me; as for other things, whether things unsensible or things irrational; or if rational, yet deceived and ignorant of the true way, they shall not trouble or distract me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 88 (Location Location)\r\n> 26. Death is a cessation from the impression of the senses, the tyranny of the passions, the errors of the mind, and the servitude of the body.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 90 (Location Location)\r\n> 30. I consist of body and soul. Unto my body all things are indifferent, for of itself it cannot affect one thing more than another with apprehension of any difference; as for my mind, all things which are not within the verge of her own operation, are indifferent unto her, and for her own operations, those altogether depend of her; neither does she busy herself about any, but those that are present; for as for future and past operations, those also are now at this present indifferent unto her.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 91 (Location Location)\r\n> 34 He that seeth the things that are now, hath Seen all that either was ever, or ever shall be, for all things are of one kind; and all like one unto another.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 91 (Location Location)\r\n> Meditate often upon the connection of all things in the world; and upon the mutual relation that they have one unto another. For all things are after a sort folded and involved one within another, and by these means all agree well together. For one thing is consequent unto another, by local motion, by natural conspiration and agreement, and by substantial union, or, reduction of all substances into one. THE SEVENTH BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 99 (Location Location)\r\n> 1. What is wickedness? It is that which many times and often thou hast already seen and known in the world. And so oft as anything doth happen that might otherwise trouble thee, let this memento presently come to thy mind, that it is that which thou hast already often seen and known.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 99 (Location Location)\r\n> 2. What fear is there that thy dogmata, or philosophical resolutions and conclusions, should become dead in thee, and lose their proper power and efficacy to make thee live happy,\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 101 (Location Location)\r\n> 6. Let not things future trouble thee. For if necessity so require that they come to pass, thou shalt (whensoever that is) be provided for them with the same reason, by which whatsoever is now present, is made both tolerable and acceptable unto thee.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 102 (Location Location)\r\n> 9. Straight of itself, not made straight.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 103 (Location Location)\r\n> 14. What is ευδαιμονία, or happiness: but αγαθός δαίμων, or, a good dæmon, or spirit?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 105 (Location Location)\r\n> 19. Whensoever any man doth trespass against other, presently consider with thyself what it was that he did suppose to be good, what to be evil, when he did trespass.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 106 (Location Location)\r\n> 22. All things (saith he) are by certain order and appointment. And what if the elements only. . . . It will suffice to remember, that all things in general are by certain order and appointment: or if it be but few.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 107 (Location Location)\r\n> 23. Out of Plato. “He then whose mind is endowed with true magnanimity, who hath accustomed himself to the contemplation both of all times, and of all things in general; can this mortal life (thinkest thou) seem any great matter unto him? It is not possible, answered he. Then neither will such a one account death a grievous thing? By no means.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 107 (Location Location)\r\n> 25. Out of several poets and comics. “It will but little avail thee, to turn thine anger and indignation upon the things themselves that have fallen across unto thee. For as for them, they are not sensible of it, etc. Thou shalt but make thyself a laughing-stock; both unto the Gods and men, etc. Our life is reaped like a ripe ear of corn; one is yet standing and another is down, etc. But if so be that I and my children be neglected by the gods, there is some reason even for that, etc. As long as right and equity is of my side, etc. Not to lament with them, not to tremble, etc.” THE TENTH BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 158 (Location Location)\r\n> 13. What use is there of suspicion at all? or, why should thoughts of mistrust, and suspicion concerning that which is future, trouble thy mind at all?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 159 (Location Location)\r\n> 18. Make it not any longer a matter of dispute or discourse, what are the signs and proprieties of a good man, but really and actually to be such.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 161 (Location Location)\r\n> 25. He that runs away from his master is a fugitive. But the law is every man’s master. He therefore that forsakes the law, is a fugitive. So is he, whosoever he be, that is either sorry, angry, or afraid, or for anything that either hath been, is, or shall be by his appointment, who is the Lord and Governor of the universe. For he truly and properly is Nomoz, or the law, as the only nemwn, or distributor and dispenser of all things that happen unto any one in his lifetime. Whatsoever then is either sorry, angry, or afraid, is a fugitive.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 162 (Location Location)\r\n> 30. When thou art offended with any man’s transgression, presently reflect upon thyself; and consider what thou thyself art guilty of in the same kind.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 166 (Location Location)\r\n> 36. There is not any man that is so happy in his death, but that some of those that are by him when he dies, will be ready to rejoice at his supposed calamity. THE ELEVENTH BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 169 (Location Location)\r\n> 1. The natural properties, and privileges of a reasonable soul are: That she seeth herself; that she can order, and compose herself: that she makes herself as she will herself: that she reaps her own fruits whatsoever, whereas plants, trees, unreasonable creatures, what fruit soever (be it either fruit properly, or analogically only) they bear, they bear them unto others, and not to themselves.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 172 (Location Location)\r\n> 7. A branch cut off from the continuity of that which was next unto it, must needs be cut off from the whole tree: so a man that is divided from another man, is divided from the whole society.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 172 (Location Location)\r\n> 9. It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art, since that all arts imitate nature. If this be so; that the most perfect and general nature of all natures should in her operation come short of the skill of arts, is most improbable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 176 (Location Location)\r\n> Seventhly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves that trouble us properly; for they have their existence in their minds and understandings only, that commit them; but our own opinions concerning those sins. Remove then, and be content to part with that conceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou hast removed thine anger. But how should I remove it? How? reasoning with thyself that it is not shameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only true evil that is, thou also wilt be driven whilest thou doest follow the common instinct of nature, to avoid that which is evil, to commit many unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything, that will make to the attainment of thy intended worldly ends.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 176 (Location Location)\r\n> Eighthly, how many things may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of anger and grief; far more grievous in themselves, than those very things which we are so grieved or angry for.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 179 (Location Location)\r\n> 20. Remember the fable of the country mouse and the city mouse, and the great fright and terror that this was put into. THE TWELFTH BOOK\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 183 (Location Location)\r\n> 1. Whatsoever thou doest hereafter aspire unto, thou mayest even now enjoy and possess, if thou doest not envy thyself thine own happiness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 184 (Location Location)\r\n> 2. God beholds our minds and understandings, bare and naked from these material vessels, and outsides, and all earthly dross. For with His simple and pure understanding, He pierceth into our inmost and purest parts, which from His, as it were by a water pipe and channel, first flowed and issued.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 184 (Location Location)\r\n> 3. I have often wondered how it should come to pass, that every man loving himself best, should more regard other men’s opinions concerning himself than his own. For if any God or grave master standing by, should command any of us to think nothing by himself but what he should presently speak out; no man were able to endure it, though but for one day. Thus do we fear more what our neighbours will think of us, than what we ourselves.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 191 (Location Location)\r\n> 23. There is but one light of the sun, though it be intercepted by walls and mountains, and other thousand objects.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 192 (Location Location)\r\n> 24. What doest thou desire? To live long. What? To enjoy the operations of a sensitive soul; or of the appetitive faculty?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 192 (Location Location)\r\n> 27. To stir up a man to the contempt of death this among other things, is of good power and efficacy, that even they who esteemed pleasure to be happiness, and pain misery, did nevertheless many of them contemn death as much as any. And can death be terrible to him, to whom that only seems good, which in the ordinary course of nature is seasonable? to him, to whom, whether his actions be many or few, so they be all good, is all one; and who whether he behold the things of the world being always the same either for many years, or for few years only, is altogether indifferent? O man! as a citizen thou hast lived, and conversed in this great city the world. Whether just for so many years, or no, what is it unto thee? Thou hast lived (thou mayest be sure) as long as the laws and orders of the city required; which may be the common comfort of all. Why then should it be grievous unto thee, if (not a tyrant, nor an unjust judge, but) the same nature that brought thee in, doth now send thee out of the world? As if the prætor should fairly dismiss him from the stage, whom he had taken in to act a while. Oh, but the play is not yet at an end, there are but three acts yet acted of it? Thou hast well said: for in matter of life, three acts is the whole play. Now to set a certain time to every man’s acting, belongs unto him only, who as first he was of thy composition, so is now the cause of thy dissolution. As for thyself, thou hast to do with neither. Go thy ways then well pleased and contented: for so is He that dismisseth thee.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![meno](/writing/images/meditations_aurelius.jpeg)"

He pleaded for a more precise method of communication and classification (\" The Ideas\"), one which would favor the investigation of facts, principles of reality, human nature, and conduct. What the Greeks meant by \"poetry\" was radically different from what we mean by poetry. Their \"poetic\" expression was a product of a collective psyche and mind.

And I myself, Meno, living as I do in this region of poverty, am as poor as the rest of the world; and I confess with shame that I know literally nothing about virtue; and when I do not know the 'quid' of anything how can I know the 'quale'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 3 (Location 386)\r\n> MENO: Then you have never met Gorgias when he was at Athens? SOCRATES: Yes, I have. MENO: And did you not think that he knew? SOCRATES: I have not a good memory, Meno, and therefore I cannot now tell what I thought of him at the time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 4 (Location 395)\r\n> Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue: there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 4 (Location 398)\r\n> SOCRATES: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for one virtue, you present me with a swarm of them\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 7 (Location 423)\r\n> MENO: If you want to have one definition of them all, I know not what to say, but that virtue is the power of governing mankind.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 7 (Location 427)\r\n> MENO: Yes, Socrates; I agree there; for justice is virtue. SOCRATES: Would you say 'virtue,' Meno, or 'a virtue'?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location 432)\r\n> MENO: Courage and temperance and wisdom and magnanimity are virtues; and there are many others.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location 432)\r\n> SOCRATES: Yes, Meno; and again we are in the same case: in searching after one virtue we have found many, though not in the same way as before; but we have been unable to find the common virtue which runs through them all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 9 (Location 440)\r\n> SOCRATES: And if he similarly asked what colour is, and you answered whiteness, and the questioner rejoined, Would you say that whiteness is colour or a colour? you would reply, A colour, because there are other colours as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 13 (Location 477)\r\n> SOCRATES: Do not he and you and Empedocles say that there are certain effluences of existence?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 15 (Location 491)\r\n> MENO: Well then, Socrates, virtue, as I take it, is when he, who desires the honourable, is able to provide it for himself; so the poet says, and I say too—'Virtue is the desire of things honourable and the power of attaining them.'\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 20 (Location 528)\r\n> SOCRATES: Why, because I asked you to deliver virtue into my hands whole and unbroken, and I gave you a pattern according to which you were to frame your answer; and you have forgotten already, and tell me that virtue is the power of attaining good justly, or with justice; and justice you acknowledge to be a part of virtue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 21 (Location 542)\r\n> MENO: O Socrates, I used to be told, before I knew you, that you were always doubting yourself and making others doubt; and now you are casting your spells over me, and I am simply getting bewitched and enchanted, and am at my wits' end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 23 (Location 554)\r\n> MENO: And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not know? What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you find what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 23 (Location 556)\r\n> You argue that a man cannot enquire either about that which he knows, or about that which he does not know; for if he knows, he has no need to enquire; and if not, he cannot; for he does not know the very subject about which he is to enquire\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 24 (Location 567)\r\n> The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all things that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of them all; and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about everything; for as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all things; there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning, out of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is strenuous and does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 31 (Location 619)\r\n> SOCRATES: Do you see, Meno, what advances he has made in his power of recollection? He did not know at first, and he does not know now, what is the side of a figure of eight feet: but then he thought that he knew, and answered confidently as if he knew, and had no difficulty; now he has a difficulty, and neither knows nor fancies that he knows. MENO: True. SOCRATES: Is he not better off in knowing his ignorance?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 36 (Location 656)\r\n> SOCRATES: And yet he has the knowledge? MENO: The fact, Socrates, is undeniable. SOCRATES: But if he did not acquire the knowledge in this life, then he must have had and learned it at some other time? MENO: Clearly he must. SOCRATES: Which must have been the time when he was not a man?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 37 (Location 661)\r\n> SOCRATES: And if the truth of all things always existed in the soul, then the soul is immortal. Wherefore be of good cheer, and try to recollect what you do not know, or rather what you do not remember.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 38 (Location 669)\r\n> SOCRATES: Had I the command of you as well as of myself, Meno, I would not have enquired whether virtue is given by instruction or not, until we had first ascertained 'what it is.' But as you think only of controlling me who am your slave, and never of controlling yourself,—such being your notion of freedom, I must yield to you, for you are irresistible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 43 (Location 711)\r\n> SOCRATES: And thus we arrive at the conclusion that virtue is either wholly or partly wisdom? MENO: I think that what you are saying, Socrates, is very true. SOCRATES: But if this is true, then the good are not by nature good? MENO: I think not. SOCRATES: If they had been, there would assuredly have been discerners of characters among us who would have known our future great men;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 47 (Location 746)\r\n> SOCRATES: You surely know, do you not, Anytus, that these are the people whom mankind call Sophists? ANYTUS: By Heracles, Socrates, forbear! I only hope that no friend or kinsman or acquaintance of mine, whether citizen or stranger, will ever be so mad as to allow himself to be corrupted by them; for they are a manifest pest and corrupting influence to those who have to do with them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 53 (Location 797)\r\n> But virtue, as I suspect, could not be taught.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 54 (Location 806)\r\n> ANYTUS: Socrates, I think that you are too ready to speak evil of men: and, if you will take my advice, I would recommend you to be careful. Perhaps there is no city in which it is not easier to do men harm than to do them good, and this is certainly the case at Athens, as I believe that you know.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 58 (Location 835)\r\n> But I cannot believe, Socrates, that there are no good men: And if there are, how did they come into existence? SOCRATES: I am afraid, Meno, that you and I are not good for much, and that Gorgias has been as poor an educator of you as Prodicus has been of me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 64 (Location 881)\r\n> SOCRATES: But if virtue is not taught, neither is virtue knowledge.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 65 (Location 892)\r\n> SOCRATES: And the women too, Meno, call good men divine—do they not? and the Spartans, when they praise a good man, say 'that he is a divine man.'\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 66 (Location 899)\r\n> SOCRATES: Then, Meno, the conclusion is that virtue comes to the virtuous by the gift of God. But we shall never know the certain truth until, before asking how virtue is given, we enquire into the actual nature of virtue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![meno](/writing/images/meno.jpg)"

In every sequence of events that becomes absurd if projected backward, there is something that is heating up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Loss (Location Direction)\r\n> The growth of entropy is nothing other than the ubiquitous and familiar natural increase of disorder.

They are—if they are at all—in a where but also in a when. They are spatially but also temporally delimited: they are events. Part III | The Sources of Time\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Perspective (Location Page)\r\n> In the impenetrable night of his wisdom a god closes the strip of days that’s to come and laughs at our human trepidation.

It is a relative one, like speed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Perspective (Location Page)\r\n> This, which is a fact, opens up the possibility that it wasn’t the universe that was in a very particular configuration in the past.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Perspective (Location Page)\r\n> When we do science, we want to describe the world in the most objective way possible. We try to eliminate distortions and optical illusions deriving from our point of view. Science aspires to objectivity, to a shared point of view about which it is possible to be in agreement. This is admirable, but we need to be wary about what we lose by ignoring the point of view from which we do the observing. In its anxious pursuit of objectivity, science must not forget that our experience of the world comes from within. Every glance that we cast toward the world is made from a particular perspective.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page Perspective (Location Page)\r\n> “indexicality”: the characteristic of certain words that have a different meaning every time they are used, a meaning determined by where, how, when, and by whom they are being spoken.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page What (Location from)\r\n> Why do the tall pine and the pale poplar intertwine their branches to provide such sweet shade for us? Why does the fleeting water invent bright spirals in the turbulent stream?

Photosynthesis deposits low entropy from the sun into plants. Animals feed on low entropy by eating. (If all we needed was energy rather than entropy, we would head for the heat of the Sahara rather than toward our next meal.) Inside every living cell, the complex web of chemical processes is a structure that opens and closes gates through which low entropy can increase.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> Happy and master of himself is the man who for every day of his life can say: “Today I have lived; tomorrow if God extends for us a horizon of dark clouds or designs a morning of limpid light, he will not change our poor past he will do nothing without the memory of events that the fleeting hour will have assigned to us.” (III, 29)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> In the Milinda Panha, a Buddhist text written in Pali in the first century of our era, Nāgasena replies to the questions of King Milinda, denying his existence as an entity: 106 King Milinda says to the sage Nāgasena: What is your name, Master? The teacher replies: I am called Nāgasena, o great king; Nāgasena is nothing but a name, a designation, an expression, a simple word: there is no person here. The king is astonished by such an extreme-sounding assertion: If no person exists, who is it then who has clothing and sustenance? Who lives according to the virtues? Who kills, who steals, who has pleasures, who lies? If there is no longer an actor, neither is there good or evil any longer. And he argues that the subject must be an autonomous being that is not reducible to its component parts: Is it the hairs that are Nāgasena, Master? Is it the nails or the teeth or the flesh or the bones? Is it the name? Is it the sensations, the perceptions, the consciousness? Is it none of these things? The sage replies that “Nāgasena” is effectively none of these things, and the king seems to have won the discussion: if Nāgasena is none of these, then he must be something else—and this something else will be the person Nāgasena who therefore exists. But the sage turns his own argument against him, asking what a chariot consists of: Are the wheels the chariot? Is the axle? Is the chassis the chariot? Is the chariot the sum of its parts?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> 1. The first is that every one of us identifies with a point of view in the world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> The second ingredient on which our identity is based is the same as for the chariot. In the process of reflecting the world, we organize it into entities:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> 3. But there is a third ingredient in the foundation of our identity, and it is probably the essential one—it is the reason this delicate discussion is taking place in a book about time: memory. We are not a collection of independent processes in successive moments. Every moment of our existence is linked by a peculiar triple thread to our past—the most recent and the most distant—by memory. Our present swarms with traces of our past. We are histories of ourselves, narratives.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> How can we come to know so clearly about the past, about time, if we are always in the present? Here and now, there is no past and no future. Where are they? Augustine concludes that they are within us: It is within my mind, then, that I measure time. I must not allow my mind to insist that time is something objective. When I measure time, I am measuring something in the present of my mind. Either this is time, or I have no idea what time is.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> It is by way of this process of retention, according to Husserl, that phenomena “constitute time.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> that “time temporalizes itself only to the extent that it is human.” 115\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page The (Location of)\r\n> The music of Strauss and the words of Hofmannsthal sing of this with devastating delicacy: 125 I remember a little girl . . . But how can that be . . . Once I was that little Resi, and then one day I became an old woman? . . . If God wills it so, why allow me to see it? Why doesn’t he hide it from me? Everything is a mystery, such a deep mystery . . . I feel the fragility of things in time. From the bottom of my heart, I feel we should cling to nothing. Everything slips through our fingers. All that we seek to hold on to dissolves. Everything vanishes, like mist and dreams . . . Time is a strange thing. When we don’t need it, it is nothing. Then, suddenly, there is nothing else. It is everywhere around us. Also within us. It seeps into our faces. It seeps into the mirror, runs through my temples . . . Between me and you it runs silently, like an hourglass. Oh, Quinquin. Sometimes I feel it flowing inexorably. Sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and stop all the clocks . . .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page the (Location of)\r\n> Perhaps God has many more seasons in store for us—or perhaps the last is to be this winter that guides back the waves of the Tyrrhenian Sea to break against the rough pumice cliffs. You must be wise. Pour the wine and enclose in this brief circle your long-cherished hope. (I, 11)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page the (Location of)\r\n> I believe, as Hans Reichenbach suggests in one of the most lucid books on the nature of time, The Direction of Time, that it was in order to escape from the anxiety time causes us that Parmenides wanted to deny its existence, that Plato imagined a world of ideas that exist outside of it, and that Hegel speaks of the moment in which the Spirit transcends temporality and knows itself in its plenitude. It is in order to escape this anxiety that we have imagined the existence of “eternity,” a strange world outside of time that we would like to be inhabited by gods, by a God, or by immortal souls.* The Sister of Sleep\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 205 (Location Location)\r\n> The brief arc of our days, O Sestius, prevents us from launching prolonged hopes. (I, 4)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 205 (Location Location)\r\n> In the third part of the great Indian epic the Mahābhārata, a powerful spirit named Yaksa asks the oldest and wisest of the Pandava, Yudhistira, what is the greatest of all mysteries. The answer given resounds across millennia: “Every day countless people die, and yet those who remain live as if they were immortals.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 212 (Location Location)\r\n> Then the song fades and ceases. “The silver thread is broken, the golden bowl is shattered, the amphora at the fountain breaks, the bucket falls into the well, the earth returns to dust.” 132 And it is fine like this. We can close our eyes, rest. This all seems fair and beautiful to me. This is time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n![meno](/writing/images/order_of_time.png)"

I am calling this technology a form of reading—what I’m calling immanent reading. 2. The Making of Sense, or Exemplary Reading\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location 155)\r\n> In all cases, we’re not reading the book in our hands. We’re reading something else as a way to make sense of this book right here and now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 8 (Location 160)\r\n> I call this mode of making sense—this turning away and seeking explanation from something bigger, this arborescent mechanics—exemplary reading. In exemplary reading, we make sense of things as an instantiation of something else.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 9 (Location 178)\r\n> ideology critique. We read something in light of a predefined “cultural” or “ideological” category such as gender, race, sexuality, Marxism, psychoanalysis.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 10 (Location 193)\r\n> Exemplary reading rests on the assumption of assumption, that there are certain things we can just count on. Why? Because experts have told us.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 10 (Location 196)\r\n> We assume that our own faculties, our minds and imaginations and capacities to feel, are not enough. And, frankly, often they aren’t. Most of us are filled with idiocy we never question.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 12 (Location 217)\r\n> How we make sense of things (what philosophers call epistemology) and who makes sense of things (the social order) are intimately intertwined.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 14 (Location 250)\r\n> When we watch TV, we often seek to see ourselves. You’re a Rachel, we’ll tell someone after watching Friends, but I’m a Monica. That is, we seek ourselves. Rather than trying to explain Picasso through Freud, we try to make sense of Friends through the enormous shadow of ourselves—as if ourselves were one clear category.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 14 (Location 258)\r\n> Exemplary reading, whether seeking basis in biography, ideology, theory, history, or ourselves, avoids the difference and newness and downright oddity of the things we experience. To make sense, we look backwards to the already known rather than looking to what’s in front of us and wondering: What new world flourishes here? 3. Making New Sense, or Immanent Reading\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 19 (Location 321)\r\n> The creator of a work is another possible reader who does not hold any authority over the sense of a text.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 19 (Location 328)\r\n> Words are experiences that not even the speaker or writer of them owns. Once uttered, the words are in play, equally for everyone. We are all readers, even of ourselves.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 20 (Location 341)\r\n> Once we remove the author—not the one who writes but the one who has authority over his writing—the very notion of a text and what it is to read that text changes dramatically:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 21 (Location 365)\r\n> But immanent sense-making begins with a different conception of language, one in which words don’t just refer to things but are networked with things in complex and ever-different ways. A word is not a sign but a gesture, a creative act that distributes sense.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 23 (Location 395)\r\n> “The amateur,” Marshall McLuhan writes, “can afford to lose” (93). That is, the amateur does not need to defend his position or sanction a field of knowledge. The amateur is free to spin the world, to say anything, to bring into play any elements. What does the amateur have to lose? As Shunryo Suzuki-Roshi says, “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.” The amateur sees possibilities where the expert shuts them down. 4. The Way of Things: Multiplicity, Affect, Style\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 29 (Location 477)\r\n> What we experience sensually, he maintained, cannot be trusted. Only what is conceptual and hence universal can be trusted, known, objective.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 32 (Location 517)\r\n> The oeuvre of William Burroughs, for example, might include his “novels,” his essays, his interviews, his readings of his novels, his shotgun paintings, his cut-up poems, his collaborations with Brion Gysin and Kerouac, his letters to everyone, most notably to Ginsberg.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 33 (Location 538)\r\n> Style is not determinative, at least not prior to the event or expression. 5. Things Happen\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 43 (Location 664)\r\n> A text is a Calder mobile: it has an infinite number of permutations depending on the environment, the nudge of the wind, the inertia of a spectator’s gaze.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 53 (Location 797)\r\n> A tulip, for instance, offers a way of standing in the world, on one’s own without being excessively stern. Grass, meanwhile, instructs us how to be a network of individuals.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 54 (Location 822)\r\n> If an exemplary reader scans the world looking for things that he can fit into his world—Oh, that’s deconstructive! That’s Deleuzian! That’s Buddhist!—the immanent reader discovers alien worlds, new ways of going, of operating, of being and becoming. 7. Good and Bad vs. Right and Wrong\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 58 (Location 880)\r\n> Burroughs, reading himself, takes issue with this characterization of his work: “To be an outlaw you must first have a base in law to reject and get out of. I never had such a base.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 58 (Location 882)\r\n> good reading is uncanny, taking the familiar and making it unfamiliar so you at once know and don’t know the thing. To see things, to think things, to sense things that you didn’t even know existed, to experience turns of thought, insights and twists, nuances and qualifications: a good reading is exhilarating. 8. Generosity\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 65 (Location 965)\r\n> Reading, then, is necessarily a matter of how things go together, of the very terms of engagement in this world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 65 (Location 966)\r\n> Reading is a matter of ethics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 66 (Location 977)\r\n> This is not a moral imperative and reading is not a moral exercise. It’s an ethical exercise. There is no code, no set of rules. There is only a very strange and beautiful principle: be generous.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 66 (Location 991)\r\n> But this is different than the No-saying of the nihilists who say no to life. When Nietzsche says no, he is saying yes to his own becoming, to his own constitution, to his own intestinal health (which was poor). Sometimes, we affirm ourselves when we say no. It all depends on how we do it. 9. Power, or Saying No\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 69 (Location 1015)\r\n> Reading the social at times demands indifference, dissimulation, even conflict. Take walking down the street in any major American city. One is assaulted by oblivious or selfish drivers, the diseased, the distracted, the downright mean.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 71 (Location 1045)\r\n> This does not mean one should always eat proverbial shit. There may be very good reasons—revolutionary or personal—for announcing your feelings. And, sometimes, this announcement may be dramatic, extreme, confrontational, even violent. But always ask yourself: What is the play here? How can I make sense of this situation so as to maximize it—not for the company or the boss or even for yourself per se but for the good of the world, for beauty and grace, for the moment and what it seems to be demanding? 10. Reading amidst the Social\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 74 (Location 1086)\r\n> This is the starting point of Gonzo journalism: join the fray, constitute the fray, be constituted by the fray as a way of knowing the world. The Gonzo journalist stands amongst his subjects, even getting stomped by some Angels. 11. Poise\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 78 (Location 1134)\r\n> The reader approaches a thing as if it were an unknown, with a certain and complex kind of stupidity: he assumes the text and nothing else. Before this text there’s no history or genre, there’s no such thing as people or religion or gender or earth—at least not for sure. 12. Diet\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 84 (Location 1230)\r\n> Sometimes, things that taste good, and even feel good, make us sick. Other times, things that taste bad, even feel bad, make us healthy—later (such as medicine). 14. Shedding Habit\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 91 (Location 1325)\r\n> People often ask children: “What’s your favorite color?” As if they are supposed to have a favorite color! But why can’t kids like all colors, or multiple colors, or different colors at different times for different occasions and different reasons?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 91 (Location 1328)\r\n> To shed habit, we must question the question.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 94 (Location 1375)\r\n> Terence McKenna recommends smoking DMT. Three big puffs of this spirit molecule and you’re transported into other dimensions. In his words, you will be astonished—not just amazed but astonished: Under the influence of DMT, the world becomes an Arabian labyrinth, a palace, a more than possible Martian jewel, vast with motifs that flood the gaping mind with complex and wordless awe. Color and the sense of a reality-unlocking secret nearby pervade the experience. There is a sense of other times, and of one’s own infancy, and of wonder, wonder and more wonder. It is an audience with the alien nuncio. 15. A Thing among Things\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 98 (Location 1430)\r\n> It would equally be a mistake to think that Pollock does not read as he writhes over the canvas. After all, each drip navigates the circuit of viscosity—the viscosity of paint and of desire: this drip should be brown and go approximately there, this one white and dripping its drip here, and so on, even if chance plays its role as well. Pollock reads his own paintings as they emerge, a cog within the engine of his “own” paintings. 17. The Uncanny Time of Reading\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 106 (Location 1522)\r\n> Reading does not happen after a thing. There is not first a thing and then the reading. A thing is always already read, always already inscribed with glances, touch, thoughts, categories, knowledge, history. There is no pure this, no pure that. There are only things that go.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 106 (Location 1525)\r\n> This is not to say that a thing only exists via human eyes, human experience. On the contrary, it is to say that human eyes, human senses, are always already touching. All things—humans, animals, arts, rocks, notions—are always already participating in the world, always already networked, always already networks themselves. A thing is always already making sense. 18. Words\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 111 (Location 1605)\r\n> Language, says Merleau-Ponty, is essentially physiognomic: “We have this acquisition [of language] as we have arms and legs” (Signs 19). In fact, “there is not a word, not a form of behavior which does not owe something to purely biological being” (M-P, PP 189). Words are particular and possible forms of bodily behavior, “one of the possible uses of my body. I reach back for the word as my hand reaches towards the part of my body which is being pricked” (180).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 114 (Location 1653)\r\n> In Nietzsche’s early lectures on rhetoric, we encounter much the same argument. He declares in one early lecture, “There is obviously no unrhetorical ‘naturalness’ of language to which one could appeal; language itself is the result of purely rhetorical arts” (21). 19. Images\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 117 (Location 1677)\r\n> An image, like a word, is a way of going, of taking up the world—a face, a sunset, light, sadness, love, ambivalence, things—and assembling them just so. Like a word, an image selects, inflects, arranges, and prioritizes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 121 (Location 1735)\r\n> This is what makes Gursky’s photographs so foreboding: when we look at them, we are not witnessing an extension of our own eyes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 121 (Location 1741)\r\n> Gursky offers us camera-vision, utterly indifferent, without categorical distinctions other than the modulation of the visible. 21. Teaching Immanent Reading\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 129 (Location 1835)\r\n> Unfortunately, students are taught that to read a book involves learning some secret—especially “literature” and, even more, art and film which either “mean” nothing or else definitely take a very special and rare decoder ring.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 129 (Location 1841)\r\n> And often they notice some interesting things such as a shift in voice from an “I” to a “we.” But they don’t know what to do with this piece of evidence. “So what?” I often scribble in the margins of their papers. “What happens when the voice shifts from first-person singular to first-person plural?” They usually then think that I’m contradicting myself: “You told us not to say what the text means. So I just wrote what I noticed.” “Yes,” I reply, “but you still haven’t told me how this work performs, what it does, how it works the reader over, what kinds of affects and effects it proffers. And, most importantly, you haven’t brought this text to life. You have not made me see it in a new light. You pointed something out I may have missed but you haven’t told me why I should care about it.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 131 (Location 1869)\r\n> focus on the relationship between what a text says and how it says it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 132 (Location 1881)\r\n> How is the book structured? The Canterbury Tales are structured quite differently than, say, War and Peace. Or take Nietzsche, for whom form is an explicit argument, his non-systematic approach a critique of systematic philosophy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 134 (Location 1919)\r\n> As with every art, practice is essential. The more one reads, the more one reads readings, the better one gets. 22. A Note on Rhetoric, with Reference to Foucault\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 135 (Location 1922)\r\n> The dictum of the sophists is strange and beautiful: Say the right thing at the right time. What’s so odd is that it at once proffers an absolute (the right thing) and a locality (at the right time).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 136 (Location 1938)\r\n> It is, as Foucault discovers, “[ a] question of right use,” of doing the right or appropriate thing. And yet this propriety is not to be fixed: “It was much more a question of a variable adjustment in which one had to take different factors into account” (53). 23. Why Immanent Reading?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 139 (Location 1975)\r\n> To read immanently means to stand towards things—towards the world, towards oneself—with a different posture: with poise and curiosity, with generosity and a will to multiplicity. It is to ask different questions: not “what does this mean?” but “what does this do?” Not “how does this fit into what I know?” but “how does this create new ways of knowing?” Works Cited\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 141 (Location 2002)\r\n> Works Cited Austin, J.L., How to Do Things with Words, Second Edition (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1962, 1975).

It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real, that is to say of an operation of deterring every real process via its operational double, a programmatic, metastable, perfectly descriptive machine that offers all the signs of the real and shortcircuits all its vicissitudes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location 58)\r\n> \"I forbade that there be any simulacra in the temples because the divinity that animates nature can never be represented.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 7 (Location 87)\r\n> Such would be the successive phases of the image: it is the reflection of a profound reality; it masks and denatures a profound reality; it masks the absence of a profound reality; it has no relation to any reality whatsoever; it is its own pure simulacrum.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 10 (Location 128)\r\n> The confinement of the scientific object is equal to the confinement of the mad and the dead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 11 (Location 136)\r\n> In the same way, with the pretext of saving the original, one forbade visitors to enter the Lascaux caves, but an exact replica was constructed five hundred meters from it, so that everyone could see them (one glances\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 11 (Location 137)\r\n> through a peephole at the authentic cave, and then one visits the reconstituted whole). It is possible that the memory of the original grottoes is itself stamped in the minds of future generations, but from now on there is no longer any difference: the duplication suffices to render both artificial.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 15 (Location 192)\r\n> This world wants to be childish in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the \"real\" world, and to conceal the fact that true childishness is everywhere-that it is that of the adults themselves who come here to act the child in order to foster illusions as to their real childishness. Disneyland is not the only one, however.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 17 (Location 214)\r\n> The denunciation of scandal is always an homage to the law.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 18 (Location 225)\r\n> Watergate is not a scandal, this is what must be said at all costs, because it is what everyone is busy concealing, this dissimulation masking a strengthening of morality, of a moral panic as one approaches the primitive (mise en) scÃ ¨ ne of capital: its instantaneous cruelty, its incomprehensible ferocity, its fundamental immorality-that is what is scandalous, unacceptable to the system of moral and economic equivalence that is the axiom of leftist thought, from the theories of the Enlightenment up to Communism. One imputes this thinking to the contract of capital, but it doesn't give a damn-it is a monstrous unprincipled enterprise, nothing more.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 24 (Location 311)\r\n> It is necessary to see in this impossibility of isolating the process of simulation the weight of an order that cannot see and conceive of anything but the real, because it cannot function anywhere

in this forking of the nuclear and the genetic, in the simultaneous assumption of the two fundamental codes of deterrence, every principle of meaning is absorbed, every deployment of the real is impossible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 46 (Location 599)\r\n> The reality of simulation is unbearable-crueler than Artaud's Theater of Cruelty, which was still an attempt to create a dramaturgy of life, the last gasp of an ideality of the body, of blood, of violence in a system that was already taking it away, toward a reabsorption of all the stakes without a trace of blood.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 50 (Location 657)\r\n> This simulacrum of the inversion or the involution of poles, this clever subterfuge, which is the secret of the whole discourse of manipulation and thus, today, in every domain, the secret of any new power in the erasure of the scene of power, in the assumption of all words from which has resulted this fantastic silent majority characteristic of our time-all of this started without a doubt in the political sphere with the democractic simulacrum, which today is the substitution for the power of God with the power of the people as the source of power, and of power as emanation with power as representation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 73 (Location 967)\r\n> There lies the supreme irony of Beaubourg: the masses throw themselves at it not because they salivate for that culture which they have been denied for centuries, but because they have for the first time the opportunity to massively participate in this great mourning of a culture that, in the end, they have always detested.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 77 (Location 1014)\r\n> But if the supply of objects brings along with it the stockpiling of men, the latent violence in the supply of objects brings with it the inverse violence of men.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 88 (Location 1155)\r\n> THE IMPLOSION OF MEANING IN THE MEDIA We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 88 (Location 1157)\r\n> In this case, one must appeal to a base productivity to replace failing media.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 90 (Location 1181)\r\n> It is useless to ask if it is the loss of communication that produces this escalation in the simulacrum, or whether it is the simulacrum that is there first for dissuasive ends, to short-circuit in advance any possibility of communication (precession of the model that calls an end to the real).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 93 (Location 1226)\r\n> Beyond the horizon of the social, there are the masses, which result from the neutralization and the implosion of the social.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 93 (Location 1230)\r\n> do the media neutralize meaning and produce unformed [informe] or informed [informÃ © e] masses, or is it the masses who victoriously resist the media by directing or absorbing all the messages that the media produce without responding to them?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 93 (Location 1233)\r\n> This absence of a response can no longer be understood at all as a strategy of power, but as a counterstrategy of the masses themselves when they encounter power.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 94 (Location 1234)\r\n> Are the mass media on the side of power in the manipulation of the masses, or are they on the side of the masses in the liquidation of meaning, in the violence perpetrated on meaning, and in fascination?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 95 (Location 1257)\r\n> Thus the strategic resistance is that of the refusal of meaning and of the spoken word-or of the hyperconformist simulation of the very mechanisms of the system, which is a form of refusal and of non-reception.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 115 (Location 1518)\r\n> HOLOGRAMS It is the fantasy of seizing reality live that continues-ever since Narcissus bent over his spring.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 115 (Location 1519)\r\n> suspending the real in the expiration of its double.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 117 (Location 1545)\r\n> The hologram, perfect image and end of the imaginary. Or rather, it is no longer an image at all-the real medium is the laser, concentrated light, quintessentialized, which is no longer a visible or reflexive light, but an abstract light of simulation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 118 (Location 1557)\r\n> In short, there is no real: the third dimension is only the imaginary of a two-dimensional world, the fourth that of a three-dimensional universe . . . Escalation in the production of a real that is more and more real through the addition of successive dimensions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 118 (Location 1562)\r\n> It is somewhat of the same paradoxical order as the formula that says that as soon as two billiard balls roll toward each other, the first touches the other before the second, or, rather, one touches the other before being touched.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 120 (Location 1586)\r\n> CRASH From a classical (even cybernetic) perspective, technology is an extension of the body.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 120 (Location 1589)\r\n> On the other hand, in the apocalyptic and baroque version of Crash* 1 technology is the mortal deconstruction of the body-no longer a functional medium, but the extension of death-the dismemberment and cutting to pieces, not in the pejorative illusion of a lost unity of the subject (which is still the horizon of psychoanalysis), but in the explosive vision of a body delivered to \"symbolic wounds,\" of a body confused with technology in its violating and violent dimension, in the savage and continual surgery that violence exercises: incisions, excisions, scarifications, the chasms of the body, of which the sexual wounds and pleasures of the body are only a particular case (and mechanical servitude in work, its pacified caricature)-a body without organs or pleasure of the organs, entirely subjected to the mark, to cutting, to the technical scar-under the shining sign of a sexuality without a referential and without limits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 125 (Location 1647)\r\n> ana-grammatization Bookmark - Page 130 · Location 1726\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 131 (Location 1728)\r\n> Three orders of simulacra: simulacra that are natural, naturalist, founded on the image, on imitation and counterfeit, that are harmonious, optimistic, and that aim for the restitution or the ideal institution of nature made in God's image;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 131 (Location 1729)\r\n> simulacra that are productive, productivist, founded on energy, force, its materialization by the machine and in the whole system of production-a Promethean aim of a continuous globalization and expansion, of an indefinite liberation of energy (desire belongs to the Utopias related to this order of simulacra);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 131 (Location 1732)\r\n> simulacra of simulation, founded on information, the model, the cybernetic game-total operationality, hyperreality, aim of total control.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 131 (Location 1733)\r\n> To the first category belongs the imaginary of the Utopia.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 131 (Location 1733)\r\n> To the second corresponds science fiction, strictly speaking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 131 (Location 1733)\r\n> To the third corresponds-is there an imaginary that might correspond to this order? The most likely answer is that the good old imaginary of science fiction is dead and that something else is in the process of emerging (not only in fiction but in theory as well).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 132 (Location 1744)\r\n> (To the limited universe of the preindustrial era, Utopia opposed an ideal, alternative universe.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 133 (Location 1766)\r\n> Until now we have always had a reserve of the imaginary-now the coefficient of reality is proportional to the reserve of the imaginary that gives it its specific weight.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 134 (Location 1768)\r\n> the conquest of space constitutes an irreversible crossing toward the loss of the terrestrial referential.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 134 (Location 1769)\r\n> There is a hemorrhaging of reality as an internal coherence of a limited universe, once the limits of this universe recede into infinity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 138 (Location 1823)\r\n> What did the torturers of the Inquisition want?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 138 (Location 1826)\r\n> In the same way, when we use and abuse animals in laboratories, in rockets, with experimental ferocity in the name of science, what confession are we seeking to extort from them from beneath the scalpel and the electrodes?

We no longer sacrifice them, we no longer punish them, and we are proud of it, but it is simply that we have domesticated them, worse: that we have made of them a racially inferior world, no longer even worthy of our justice, but only of our affection and social charity, no longer worthy of punishment and of death, but only of experimentation and extermination like meat from the butchery.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 145 (Location 1919)\r\n> Formerly, the cultural hero annihilated the beast, the dragon, the monster-and from the spilt blood plants, men, culture were born; today, it is the beast King Kong who comes to sack our industrial metropolises, who comes to liberate us from our culture, a culture dead from having purged itself of all real monstrosity and from having broken its pact with it (which was expressed in the film by the primitive gift of the woman).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 145 (Location 1921)\r\n> The profound seduction of the film comes from this inversion of meaning: all inhumanity has gone over to the side of men, all humanity has gone over to the side of captive bestiality, and to the respective seduction of man and of beast, monstrous seduction of one order by the other, the human and the bestial.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 148 (Location 1957)\r\n> animals maintain a compulsory discourse.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 150 (Location 1980)\r\n> The unconscious is the site of the indefinite repetition of subjective repression and fantasies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 151 (Location 1997)\r\n> That animals wander is a myth, and the current representation of the unconscious and of desire as erratic and nomadic belongs to the same \"order.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 153 (Location 2020)\r\n> THE REMAINDER When everything is taken away, nothing is left.

Power (or what takes its place) no longer believes in the university.

Okay.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 11 (Location Location)\r\n> Just remember that the things you put into your head are there forever, he said. You might want to think about that. You forget some things, dont you? Yes. You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 32 (Location Location)\r\n> On this road there are no godspoke men. They are gone and I am left and they have taken with them the world. Query: How does the never to be differ from what never was?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 50 (Location Location)\r\n> Who is it? said the boy. I dont know. Who is anybody?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 55 (Location Location)\r\n> He was sure he had them mostly wrong and he made up new games and gave them made up names.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 57 (Location Location)\r\n> We’re the walking dead in a horror film.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 58 (Location Location)\r\n> We used to talk about death, she said. We dont any more. Why is that? I dont know. It’s because it’s here. There’s nothing left to talk about.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 86 (Location Location)\r\n> He looked down at the boy. Shivering in his coats. He bent over and kissed him on his gritty brow. We wont hurt the dog, he said. I promise.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 99 (Location Location)\r\n> If we were going to die would you tell me? I dont know. We’re not going to die.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 107 (Location Location)\r\n> But you think I might lie to you about dying. Yes. Okay. I might. But we’re not dying. Okay.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 137 (Location Location)\r\n> There were times when he sat watching the boy sleep that he would begin to sob uncontrollably but it wasnt about death. He wasnt sure what it was about but he thought it was about beauty or about goodness. Things that he’d no longer any way to think about at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 138 (Location Location)\r\n> He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 140 (Location Location)\r\n> He opened the cabinet. Old catalogs. Packets of seed.

They dont give up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 154 (Location Location)\r\n> Dear people, thank you for all this food and stuff. We know that you saved it for yourself and if you were here we wouldnt eat it no matter how hungry we were and we’re sorry that you didnt get to eat it and we hope that you’re safe in heaven with God.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 179 (Location Location)\r\n> People were always getting ready for tomorrow. I didnt believe in that. Tomorrow wasnt getting ready for them. It didnt even know they were there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 182 (Location Location)\r\n> You dont want to say your name. I dont want to say it. Why? I couldnt trust you with it. To do something with it. I dont want anybody talking about me. To say where I was or what I said when I was there. I mean, you could talk about me maybe. But nobody could say that it was me. I could be anybody. I think in times like these the less said the better. If something had happened and we were survivors and we met on the road then we’d have something to talk about. But we’re not. So we dont.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 183 (Location Location)\r\n> Where men cant live gods fare no better. You’ll see. It’s better to be alone. So I hope that’s not true what you said because to be on the road with the last god would be a terrible thing so I hope it’s not true. Things will be better when everybody’s gone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 185 (Location Location)\r\n> You wont wish us luck either, will you? the man said. I dont know what that would mean. What luck would look like. Who would know such a thing?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 202 (Location Location)\r\n> When your dreams are of some world that never was or of some world that never will be and you are happy again then you will have given up. Do you understand? And you cant give up. I wont let you.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 204 (Location Location)\r\n> Why didnt they leave the road? They couldnt.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 291 (Location Location)\r\n> What’s the bravest thing you ever did? He spat into the road a bloody phlegm. Getting up this morning, he said.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 297 (Location Location)\r\n> Look around you, he said. There is no prophet in the earth’s long chronicle who’s not honored here today. Whatever form you spoke of you were right.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 301 (Location Location)\r\n> When he came back he knelt beside his father and held his cold hand and said his name over and over again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 306 (Location Location)\r\n> I’ll talk to you every day, he whispered. And I wont forget. No matter what. Then he rose and turned and walked back out to the road.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](/writing/images/the_road.jpeg)\r\n"

It implied, she would write, that “humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself,” and by all the qualities (Colette’s strain of “virility”) she is presumed to lack. Her “twinship” with Sartre was an illusion. Volume I Facts and Myths\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 3)\r\n> I hesitated a long time before writing a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially for women; and it is not new.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 3)\r\n> what is a woman? “Tota mulier in utero: she is a womb,” some say.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 3)\r\n> Is femininity secreted by the ovaries? Is it enshrined in a Platonic heaven?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 4)\r\n> But conceptualism has lost ground: biological and social sciences no longer believe there are immutably determined entities that define given characteristics like those of the woman, the Jew, or the black; science considers characteristics as secondary reactions to a situation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 4)\r\n> If some backward individual still takes herself for a woman, her friends advise her to undergo psychoanalysis to get rid of this obsession. Referring to a book—a very irritating one at that—Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, Dorothy Parker wrote: “I cannot be fair about books that treat women as women. My idea is that all of us, men as well as women, whoever we are, should be considered as human beings.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 4)\r\n> But nominalism is a doctrine that falls a bit short; and it is easy for antifeminists to show that women are not men.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 4)\r\n> The defiant position that American women occupy proves they are haunted by the feeling of their own femininity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 4)\r\n> anyone can clearly see that humanity is split into two categories of individuals with manifestly different clothes, faces, bodies, smiles, movements, interests, and occupations; these differences are perhaps superficial; perhaps they are destined to disappear. What is certain is that for the moment they exist in a strikingly obvious way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 5)\r\n> A man never begins by positing himself as an individual of a certain sex: that he is a man is obvious.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 5)\r\n> The relation of the two sexes is not that of two electrical poles: the man represents both the positive and the neuter to such an extent that in French hommes designates human beings, the particular meaning of the word vir being assimilated into the general meaning of the word “homo.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 5)\r\n> I used to get annoyed in abstract discussions to hear men tell me: “You think such and such a thing because you’re a woman.” But I know my only defense is to answer, “I think it because it is true,” thereby eliminating my subjectivity; it was out of the question to answer, “And you think the contrary because you are a man,” because it is understood that being a man is not a particularity; a man is in his right by virtue of being man; it is the woman who is in the wrong.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 5)\r\n> “The female is female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities,” Aristotle said. “We should regard women’s nature as suffering from natural defectiveness.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 5)\r\n> Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself; she is not considered an autonomous being.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 6)\r\n> No group ever defines itself as One without immediately setting up the Other opposite itself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 9)\r\n> The tie that binds her to her oppressors is unlike any other. The division of the sexes is a biological given, not a moment in human history.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 9)\r\n> This is the fundamental characteristic of woman: she is the Other at the heart of a whole whose two components are necessary to each other.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 9)\r\n> Biological need—sexual desire and desire for posterity—which makes the male dependent on the female, has not liberated women socially.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 9)\r\n> Master and slave are also linked by a reciprocal economic need that does not free the slave. That is, in the master-slave relation, the master does not posit the need he has for the other; he holds the power to satisfy this need and does not mediate it; the slave, on the other hand, out of dependence, hope, or fear, internalizes his need for the master; however equally compelling the need may be to them both, it always plays in favor of the oppressor over the oppressed: this explains the slow pace of working-class liberation, for example.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 10)\r\n> Refusing to be the Other, refusing complicity with man, would mean renouncing all the advantages an alliance with the superior caste confers on them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 10)\r\n> Indeed, beside every individual’s claim to assert himself as subject—an ethical claim—lies the temptation to flee freedom and to make himself into a thing:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 10)\r\n> Among the blessings Plato thanked the gods for was, first, being born free and not a slave and, second, a man and not a woman.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 11)\r\n> Lawmakers, priests, philosophers, writers, and scholars have gone to great lengths to prove that women’s subordinate condition was willed in heaven and profitable on earth.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 11)\r\n> “It is much easier to accuse one sex than to excuse the other,” says Montaigne.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 11)\r\n> It is striking that in the sixteenth century, to keep a married woman under wardship, the authority of Saint Augustine affirming “the wife is an animal neither reliable nor stable” is called on, whereas the unmarried woman is recognized as capable of managing her own affairs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 11)\r\n> It is only in the eighteenth century that deeply democratic men begin to consider the issue objectively. Diderot, for one, tries to prove that, like man, woman is a human being.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 12)\r\n> To prove women’s inferiority, antifeminists began to draw not only, as before, on religion, philosophy, and theology but also on science: biology, experimental psychology, and so forth. At most they were willing to grant “separate but equal status” to the other sex.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 13)\r\n> Some men feel threatened by women’s competition. In Hebdo-Latin the other day, a student declared: “Every woman student who takes a position as a doctor or lawyer is stealing a place from us.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 13)\r\n> One of the benefits that oppression secures for the oppressor is that the humblest among them feels superior: in the United States a “poor white” from the South can console himself for not being a “dirty nigger”; and more prosperous whites cleverly exploit this pride. Likewise, the most mediocre of males believes himself a demigod next to women.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 13)\r\n> For all those suffering from an inferiority complex, this is a miraculous liniment; no one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or more disdainful, than a man anxious about his own virility.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 14)\r\n> they can hardly be blamed for not wanting to lightheartedly sacrifice all the benefits they derive from the myth: they know what they lose by relinquishing the woman of their dreams, but they do not know what the woman of tomorrow will bring them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 15)\r\n> To see clearly, one needs to get out of these ruts; these vague notions of superiority, inferiority, and equality that have distorted all discussions must be discarded in order to start anew.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 15)\r\n> It is a sophism to claim that Epimenides should be enclosed within the concept of Cretan and all Cretans within the concept of liar: it is not a mysterious essence that dictates good or bad faith to men and women; it is their situation that disposes them to seek the truth to a greater or lesser extent.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 16)\r\n> We cannot really know what the word “happiness” means, and still less what authentic values it covers; there is no way to measure the happiness of others, and it is always easy to call a situation that one would like to impose on others happy: in particular, we declare happy those condemned to stagnation, under the pretext that happiness is immobility.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 16)\r\n> Every time transcendence lapses into immanence, there is degradation of existence into “in-itself,” of freedom into facticity; this fall is a moral fault if the subject consents to it; if this fall is inflicted on the subject, it takes the form of frustration and oppression; in both cases it is an absolute evil.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 16)\r\n> Every individual concerned with justifying his existence experiences his existence as an indefinite need to transcend himself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page > (Location 20)\r\n> How, in the feminine condition, can a human being accomplish herself? What paths are open to her? Which ones lead to dead ends? How can she find independence within dependence? What circumstances limit women’s freedom\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Data)\r\n> The word “female” evokes a saraband of images: an enormous round egg snatching and castrating the agile sperm; monstrous and stuffed, the queen termite reigning over the servile males; the praying mantis and the spider, gorged on love, crushing their partners and gobbling them up; the dog in heat running through back alleys, leaving perverse smells in her wake; the monkey showing herself off brazenly, sneaking away with flirtatious hypocrisy. And the most splendid wildcats, the tigress, lioness, and panther, lie down slavishly under the male’s imperial embrace, inert, impatient, shrewd, stupid, insensitive, lewd, fierce, and humiliated. Man projects all females at once onto woman.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Data)\r\n> Males and females are two types of individuals who are differentiated within one species for the purposes of reproduction; they can be defined only correlatively. But it has to be pointed out first that the very meaning of division of the species into two sexes is not clear. Bookmark - Chapter 1 Biological Data > Page 22 · Location 644\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Data)\r\n> observations have proved that asexual multiplication can occur indefinitely without any noticeable degeneration; this is particularly striking in bacilli; more and more—and bolder and even bolder—parthenogenetic experiments have been carried out, and in many species the male seems radically useless.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Data)\r\n> The existence of heterogenetic gametes alone does not necessarily mean there are two distinct sexes;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Data)\r\n> The Platonic myth has it that in the beginning there were men, women, and androgynes; each individual had a double face, four arms, four legs, and two bodies joined together; one day they were split into two “as one would split eggs in two,” and ever since then each half seeks to recover its other half: the gods decided later that new human beings would be created by the coupling of two unlike halves. This story only tries to explain love: the differentiation of sexes is taken as a given from the start.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Data)\r\n> Presence in the world vigorously implies the positing of a body that is both a thing of the world and a point of view on this world: but this body need not possess this or that particular structure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Page)\r\n> The worst curse on woman is her exclusion from warrior expeditions; it is not in giving life but in risking his life that man raises himself above the animal; this is why throughout humanity, superiority has been granted not to the sex that gives birth but to the one that kills.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 2 (Location Page)\r\n> And yet Evil needs Good, matter needs the idea, and night needs light.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 3 (Location Page)\r\n> the Greek woman is reduced to semi-slavery; she does not even have the freedom to complain: Aspasia and the more passionate Sappho are barely able to make a few grievances heard. In Homer, there are remnants of the heroic period when women had some power: still, the warriors roundly send them off to their chambers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 3 (Location Page)\r\n> Latin literature had always respected women: then satirists went wild against them. They attacked, in fact, not women in general but mainly contemporary women.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 4 (Location Page)\r\n> Women in the seventeenth century will continue to distinguish themselves essentially in intellectual spheres; social life and culture are spreading; women play a considerable role in salons; by the very fact they are not involved in the construction of the world, they have the leisure to indulge in conversation, the arts, and literature; they are not formally educated, but through discussions, readings, and instruction by private preceptors or public lectures they succeed in acquiring greater knowledge than their husbands:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Page)\r\n> A second consequence of the resigned inertia of women workers was the salaries they were forced to accept. Various explanations with multiple factors have been given for the phenomenon of low female salaries. It is insufficient to say that women have fewer needs than men: that is only a subsequent justification. Rather, women, as we have seen, did not know how to defend themselves against exploitation; they had to compete with prisons that dumped products without labor costs on the market; they competed with each other.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Page)\r\n> In 1913, the suffrage movement was organized on the militant English model. Two women led it: Doris Stevens and a young Quaker, Alice Paul. From Wilson they obtained the right to march with banners and signs;* they then organized a campaign of lectures, meetings, marches, and manifestations of all sorts. From the nine states where women voted, women voters went with great pomp and circumstance to the Capitol, demanding the feminine vote for the whole nation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Page)\r\n> It is always difficult to describe a myth; it does not lend itself to being grasped or defined; it haunts consciousnesses without ever being posited opposite them as a fixed object.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Page)\r\n> An important text where we will find a synthesis of almost all these myths is Jean-Richard Bloch’s La nuit kurde (A Night in Kurdistan), in which he describes young Saad’s embraces of a much older but still beautiful woman during the plundering of a city: The night abolished the contours of things and feelings alike. He was no longer clasping a woman to him. He was at last nearing the end of an interminable voyage that had been pursued since the beginning of the world. Little by little he dissolved into an immensity that cradled him round without shape or end. All women were confused into one giant land, folded upon him, suave as desire burning in summer … He, meanwhile, recognised with a fearful admiration the power that is enclosed within woman, the long, stretched, satin thighs, the knees like two ivory hills. When he traced the polished arch of the back, from the waist to the shoulders, he seemed to be feeling the vault that supports the world. But the belly ceaselessly drew him, a tender and elastic ocean, whence all life is born, and whither it returns, asylum of asylums, with its tides, horizons, illimitable surfaces. Then he was seized with a rage to pierce that delightful envelope, and at last win to the very source of all this beauty. A simultaneous urge wrapped them one within the other. The woman now only lived to be cleaved by the share, to open to him her vitals, to gorge herself with the humours of the beloved. Their ecstasy was murderous. They came together as if with stabbing daggers … He, man, the isolated, the separated, the cut off, was going to gush forth from out of his own substance, he, the first, would come forth from his fleshly prison and at last go free, matter and soul, into the universal matrix. To him was reserved the unheard of happiness of overpassing the limits of the creature, of dissolving into the one exaltation object and subject, question and answer, of annexing to being all that is not being, and of embracing, in an unextinguishable river, the empire of the unattainable … But each coming and going of the bow awoke, in the precious instrument it held at its mercy, vibrations more and more piercing. Suddenly, a last spasm unloosed him from the zenith, and cast him down again to earth, to the mire.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Page)\r\n> As the woman’s desire is not quenched, she imprisons her lover between her legs, and he feels in spite of himself his desire returning: she is thus an enemy power who grabs his virility, and while possessing her again, he bites her throat so deeply that he kills her. The cycle from mother to woman-lover to death meanders to a complex close.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location Page)\r\n> As the Virgin Mary is the most perfected image, the most widely venerated image of the regenerated woman devoted to the Good, it is interesting to see how she appears through literature and iconography. Here are passages from medieval litanies showing how fervent Christians addressed her: Most high Virgin, thou art the fertile Dew, the Fountain of Joy, the Channel of mercy, the Well of living waters that cools our passions. Thou art the Breast from which God nurses orphans. Thou art the Marrow, the Inside, the Core of all good. Thou art the guileless Woman whose love never changes. Thou art the Probatic Pool, the Remedy of lepers, the subtle Physician whose like is found neither in Salerno nor in Montpellier. Thou art the Lady of healing hands, whose fingers so beautiful, so white, so long, restore noses and mouths, give new eyes and ears. Thou calmest passions, givest life to the paralyzed, givest strength to the weak, risest the dead. Most of the feminine attributes we have referred to are found in these invocations. The Virgin is fertility, dew, and the source of life; many of the images show her at the well, the spring, or the fountain; the expression “Fountain of Life” was one of the most common; she was not a creator, but she nourishes, she brings to the light of day what was hidden in the earth. She is the deep reality hidden under the appearance of things: the Core, the Marrow. Volume II Lived Experience\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location >)\r\n> We will see later how complex the relation is between the mother and the daughter: for the mother, the daughter is both her double and an other, the mother cherishes her and at the same time is hostile to her; she imposes her own destiny on her child: it is a way to proudly claim her own femininity and also to take revenge on it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location >)\r\n> An interesting document on this point is the study made by Dr. Liepmann; here are a few responses given to him by young girls about their sexual initiation: I continued to stray among my nebulous and twisted ideas. No one broached the subject, neither my mother nor my schoolteacher; no book treated the subject fully. Little by little a sort of perilous and ugly mystery was woven around the act, which at first had seemed so natural to me. The older girls of twelve used crude jokes to bridge the gap between themselves and our classmates. All that was still so vague and disgusting; we argued about where the baby was formed, if perhaps the thing only took place once for the man since marriage was the occasion for so much fuss. My period at fifteen was another new surprise. It was my turn to be caught up, in a way, in the round. … Sexual initiation! An expression never to be mentioned in our parents’ house!… I searched in books, but I agonized and wore myself out looking for the road to follow … I went to a boys’ school: for my schoolteacher the question did not even seem to exist … Horlam’s work, Little Boy and Little Girl, finally brought me the truth. My tense state and unbearable overexcitement disappeared, although I was very unhappy and took a long time to recognize and understand that eroticism and sexuality alone constitute real love. Stages of my initiation: (1) First questions and a few vague notions (totally unsatisfactory). From three and a half to eleven years old … No answers to the questions I had in the following years. When I was seven, right there feeding my rabbit, I suddenly saw little naked ones underneath her … My mother told me that in animals and people little ones grow in their mother’s belly and come out through the loins. This birth through the loins seemed unreasonable to me … a nursemaid told me about pregnancy, birth, and menstruation … Finally, my father replied to my last question about his true function with obscure stories about pollen and pistil. (2) Some attempts at personal experimentation (eleven to thirteen years old). I dug out an encyclopedia and a medical book … It was only theoretical information in strange gigantic words. (3) Testing of acquired knowledge (thirteen to twenty): (a) in daily life, (b) in scientific works. At eight, I often played with a boy my age. One day we broached the subject. I already knew, because my mother had already told me, that a woman has many eggs inside her … and that a child was born from one of these eggs whenever the mother strongly desired it … Giving this same answer to my friend, I received this reply: “You are completely stupid! When our butcher and his wife want a baby, they go to bed and do dirty things.” I was indignant … We had then (around twelve and a half) a maid who told me all sorts of scandalous tales. I never said a word to Mama, as I was ashamed; but I asked her if sitting on a man’s knees could give you a baby. She explained everything as best she could. At school I learned where babies emerged, and I had the feeling that it was something horrible. But how did they come into the world? We both formed a rather monstrous idea about the thing, especially since one winter morning on the way to school together in the darkness we met a certain man who showed us his sexual parts and asked us, “Don’t they seem good enough to eat?” Our disgust was inconceivable, and we were literally nauseated. Until I was twenty-one, I thought babies were born through the navel. A little girl took me aside and asked me: “Do you know where babies come from?” Finally she decided to speak out: “Goodness! How foolish you are! Kids come out of women’s stomachs, and for them to be born, women have to do completely disgusting things with men!” Then she went into details about how disgusting. But I had become totally transformed, absolutely unable to believe that such things could be possible. We slept in the same room as our parents … One night later I heard take place what I had thought was impossible, and, yes, I was ashamed, I was ashamed of my parents. All of this made of me another being. I went through horrible moral suffering. I considered myself a deeply depraved creature because I was now aware of these things.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 1 (Location >)\r\n> puberty has a radically different meaning for the two sexes because it does not announce the same future to them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 2 (Location Girl)\r\n> I am the little notebook Nice, pretty, and discreet Tell me all your secrets I am the little notebook. 2\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 2 (Location Girl)\r\n> This is how Virginia Woolf describes the impressions of a young coquette during a party: I feel myself shining in the dark. Silk is on my knee. My silk legs rub smoothly together. The stones of a necklace lie cold on my throat … I am arrayed, I am prepared … My hair is swept in one curve. My lips are precisely red. I am ready now to join men and women on the stairs, my peers. I pass them, exposed to their gaze, as they are to mine … I now begin to unfurl, in this scent, in this radiance, as a fern when its curled leaves unfurl … I feel a thousand capacities spring up in me. I am arch, gay, languid, melancholy by turns; I am rooted, but I flow. All gold, flowing that way, I say to this one, “Come”… He approaches. He makes towards me. This is the most exciting moment I have ever known. I flutter. I ripple … Are we not lovely sitting together here, I in my satin; he in black and white? My peers may look at me now. I look straight back at you, men and women. I am one of you. This is my world … The door opens. The door goes on opening. Now I think, next time it opens the whole of my life will be changed … The door opens. Come, I say to this one, rippling gold from head to heels. “Come,” and he comes towards me. 18\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Married)\r\n> The destiny that society traditionally offers women is marriage. Even today, most women are, were, or plan to be married, or they suffer from not being so. Marriage is the reference by which the single woman is defined, whether she is frustrated by, disgusted at, or even indifferent to this institution. Thus we must continue this study by analyzing marriage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Married)\r\n> The economic evolution of woman’s condition is in the process of upsetting the institution of marriage: it is becoming a union freely entered into by two autonomous individuals;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Married)\r\n> This is the difficulty: love and falling in love are spontaneous, marriage is a decision; yet falling in love should be awakened by marriage or by decision: wanting to marry; this means that what is the most spontaneous must at the same time be the freest decision, and what is, because of the spontaneity, so inexplicable that it must be attributed to a divinity,\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Married)\r\n> On September 23, 1862, Sophia gets married and leaves her family in the evening: A difficult and painful feeling gripped my throat and held me tight. I then felt that the time had come to leave forever my family and all those I loved deeply and with whom I had always lived … The farewells began and were ghastly … Now the last minutes. I had intentionally reserved the farewells to my mother till the end … When I pulled myself from her embrace and without turning around I went to take my place in the car, she uttered a heart-rending cry I have never forgotten all my life. Autumn rain did not cease to fall … Huddled in my corner, overwhelmed with fatigue and sorrow, I let my tears flow. Leon Nikolaivitch seemed very surprised, even discontent … When we left the city, I felt in the depths a sentiment of fear … The darkness oppressed me. We barely said anything to each other until the first stop, Birioulev, if I am not mistaken. I remember that Leon Nikolaivitch was very tender and attentive to my every need. At Birioulev, we were given the rooms said to be for the tsar, big rooms with furniture upholstered in red rep that was not very welcoming. We were brought the samovar. Cuddled up in a corner of the couch, I kept silent as a condemned person. “Well!” said Leon Nikolaivitch to me, “if you did the honors.” I obeyed and served the tea. I was upset and could not free myself from a kind of fear. I did not dare address Leon Nikolaivitch in the familiar form and avoided calling him by his name. For a long time I continued to use the formal form. Twenty-four hours later, they arrive at Yasnaya Polyana. She resumes her diary again on October 8. She feels anxious. She suffers from the fact that her husband has a past: I always dreamt of the man I would love as a completely whole, new pure, person … in these childish dreams, which I still find hard to give up … When he kisses me I am always thinking, “I am not the first woman he has loved.” The following day she notes: I feel downcast all the same. I had such a depressing dream last night, and it is weighing on me, although I do not remember it in detail. I thought of Maman today and grew dreadfully sad … I seem to be asleep all the time and unable to wake up … Something is weighing on me. I keep thinking that at any moment I might die. It is so strange to be thinking such things now that I have a husband. I can hear him in there sleeping. I am frightened of being on my own. He will not let me go into his room, which makes me very sad. All physical things disgust him.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Married)\r\n> It is terrible to be alone. I am not used to it. There was so much life and love at home, and it’s so lifeless here without him. He is almost always on his own … He … finds pleasure not in the company of those close to him, as I do, but in his work … he never had a family.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 5 (Location Married)\r\n> April 20:* … Lyova ignores me more and more. The physical side of love is very important for him. This is terrible, for me it is quite the opposite.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 9 (Location Maturity)\r\n> The history of woman—because she is still trapped in her female functions—depends much more than man’s on her physiological destiny; and the arc of this destiny is more erratic, more discontinuous, than the masculine one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 11 (Location Narcissist)\r\n> I also recall a young woman I saw one morning in the restroom of a café; she was holding a rose, and she looked a little drunk; she brought her lips to the mirror as if to drink her image, and she was murmuring while smiling: “Adorable, I find myself adorable.” Both priestess and idol, the narcissist crowned with glory hovers in the heart of eternity, and on the other side of the clouds kneeling creatures worship her: she is God contemplating himself. “I love myself, I am my God!” said Mme Mejerowsky.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 13 (Location Mystic)\r\n> Love has been assigned to woman as her supreme vocation, and when she addresses it to a man, she is seeking God in him: if circumstances deny her human love, if she is disappointed or demanding, she will choose to worship the divinity in God himself. It is true that there are also men who have burned with this flame; but they are rare, and their fervor has been of a highly refined intellectual form.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 14 (Location Independent)\r\n> since from the start she has fewer chances than man, she does not feel a priori guilty toward him; it is not up to her to compensate for social injustice, and she is not called upon to do so.

Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions-they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 14 (Location 126)\r\n> a \"rational\" being, he now places his behavior under the control of abstractions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 16 (Location 144)\r\n> As a genius of construction man raises himself far above the bee in the following way: whereas the bee builds with wax that he gathers from nature, man builds with the far more delicate conceptual material which he first has to manufacture from himself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Note on Page 18 (Location 161)\r\n> It is even a difficult thing for him to admit to himself that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different world from the one that man does, and that the question of which of these perceptions of the world is the more correct one is quite meaningless,\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](/writing/images/truth_lies.jpg)\r\n"

Sir Please,\r\nSign with pen so I can return to breeze.”\r\nWith gusto, the stork thrust a pad into\r\nmy hands, and said “I would like to go soon.”\r\n\r\nAnd I look down to where a midnight pen\r\nHas appeared in hand where air had just been\r\nI sigh, and sign for, it can’t be denied\r\nThis is mine, a beautiful sight inside\r\n\r\nIn those satin sheets, milky white, all mine\r\nOf warmth. That is mine. That is mine I sign.\r\nThe Stork passes the babe, wrapped in sheet, And\r\nturns around, leaping from ground with his feet.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear. Dear oh dear. What am I to do?\r\nI have signed on pad, and said it is true.\r\nYou are mine and I am yours, your father,\r\nOh, just when I deemed to not be bothered”\r\n\r\nI call out to house, for a new member\r\nJoined our ranks in the month of November.\r\n“I have news to share.” “You do?” “Yes in fact.”\r\nMy love looks to me, and our dog and cat.\r\n\r\n“We have given birth, and you will mother.”\r\n“Oh joyous! I have waited forever!”\r\nAnd she leaps and soars to embrace me now,\r\nAs too our dog barks loud and shy cat meows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![cover](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1702491389997.png)"

Indeed, tech giants act as the Greek gods of antiquity. Wars are started in their name, rebels are sacrificed and slaughtered. Monuments that scrape the sky were built in their honor. Legally, we have defined them as individuals, with a right to life, liberty, and property. Corporations, now the size at which Adam Smith could not have fathomed, no longer exist within the confines of humans; they have taken our place and then ascended. Corporations were meant to represent the people, the capitalists, but now they have become capitalists. Consider the names: John Pierpont Morgan, Henry Ford, Walt Disney. Once the names of a person, these corporations have outlived their origin until Walt is all but forgotten. Disney is not the man, but the mouse.\r\n\r\n“Such would be the successive phases of the image: it is the reflection of a profound reality; it masks and denatures a profound reality; it masks the absence of a profound reality; it has no relation to any reality whatsoever; it is its own pure simulacrum.” We feel, at our core, that the patterns of our lives are breaking down. It has become an existential crisis, likened to the “extinction of humanity” now that AI has entered the playing field. Has it been said that AI simply copies what humans have already written?\r\n \r\nYet, we continue to exist. At least for the moment, humans make the decisions, and the symbols replacing the ‘real’ replace the ‘real’ of humans. Indeed, while this remains to be a post-modern and pre-post-human world, the creations we form are to be designed for humans. As we cling to our final breaths before breathing is enhanced (regulated) by a machine, we can, and should enjoy the fresh air. Touch grass and enjoy the liberty of owning your yard- a statistical improbability for most born after the turn of the millennium. At least we are alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n![simulacrum](/writing/images/simulacrum.png)"

    "content": "## The Silence of Indifference\r\n\r\n2023-12-07\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the realm of shadowed thoughts, where whispers fade, Dwells Self, aloof, in indifference's shade. Its gaze, though distant, cuts sharper than steel, Ignoring Other, whose existence it won't feel.\r\n\r\nThrough halls of neglect, the cold silence spreads, As Self walks unheeding, where empathy treads. Indifference, the weapon, more cruel than a blade, Leaving Other in darkness, unseen and unswayed.\r\n\r\nOther, the forgotten, in the void of neglect, Bears the invisible scars, the pain of defect. Unseen, unheard, in the silence they scream, A ghost in the world of Self's indifferent dream.\r\n\r\nEach step Self takes, blind to the cries, Carves deeper the chasm where Other hopes to die. A void of attention, a desert of care, Where Other's pleas vanish in the uncaring air.\r\n\r\nIn this dance of neglect, where attention never pairs, Self and Other, trapped in unspoken affairs. The pain of indifference, a silent, ruthless storm, In this world of neglect, where coldness is the norm.\r\n\r\nSelf, the ignorer, with eyes that never see, Leaves trails of pain in its apathy. A master of silence, with each turn so deft, Echoing loudly in the spaces Other has left.\r\n\r\nOther, the invisible, with wounds that never bleed, Suffers in silence, their existence a seed In the barren soil of Self's indifferent land, Where no acknowledgment grows, no understanding hand.\r\n\r\nIn this twisted waltz, where silence intertwines, Self and Other, in fate's cruel designs. The ignored and the ignorer, one and the same, In this masquerade of silence, a heartless game.\r\n\r\nThe revelation dawns, in this world so stark, The pain of being unseen, a mark. The true agony lies in the indifferent breath, Of Self, who renders Other as good as death.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of the ignored, where silent echoes trace, Lies the most painful wound, an empty space. Where Self's indifference cuts deeper than any knife, Leaving Other to wither, unseen in life.\r\n\r\n![surgeon](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1702008523288.png)"

He stayed in our home, briefly, and it was uncanny. As though something was simultaneously more complete and completely wrong. One afternoon, he took a shower. When he came to sit down at the couch next to me, he told me a story. There was a spider in the tub while he was showering. He said that he watched it struggle against the flow of water. That it was funny, how it struggled. The spider was eventually washed down. I cannot remember now if he pointed the shower head at the spider, as one does with a Glock. But I remember the story as though he killed the spider, the one that was struggling to crawl out of the tub. I think about the spider often, absurdly as though it was an aborted sibling. Elevating the life of the spider, beyond its miserably short existence. How tragic that I remember it.\r\n\r\n![spider](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1702227940813.png)"

I am in a stroller, and for some reason, my family leaves me. I crawl from the stroller, and then suddenly I am on the edge of the retaining glass at a mall. I am crawling along a small ledge, and I know I will fall. I fear that fall. And then I do fall, and I die. Over and over I would have these nightmares. Sometimes I would be caught by a bystander below, but mostly I would fall and die. Strangely, my family was never ready to catch me.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I grew a bit older, and I was allowed to watch Home Alone. Emboldened and curious by the new world of movies, I snuck downstairs to watch The Dark Crystal. The evil puppets were my first exposure to a “Monster.” \r\n\r\nMy dreams became creepy puppets invading my home. In my dreams I would run and hide in the closet, screaming for help, but my family would either sleep through my screams or simply not be home. Then they would rip open the closet door and kill me. Repeatedly I died in my dreams. It was Hell to sleep. It meant pain, torture, fear, and death. Each night, I would hide under my blankets and would hold my breath so the monsters could not hear me.\r\n\r\n I wonder if fear is the chicken or the egg. When I’m afraid of heights, is it from my dreams as an infant, or was it fear that led to the dreams? Now, as an adult, I have an irrational fear of the second floor of malls. I walk as closely as I can to the storefronts, and I often refuse to cross the center walkways. I diligently circle around the entire mall to reach the other side if need be. \r\n\r\n\r\n![sleep_fall](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1702230091875.png)\r\n\r\n"

    "content": "## The Joy of the Cave\r\n\r\nThe other day I attended a dinner party with several close friends. At some point I made reference to a meme that I had recently encountered and the rest of our group stared at me in bewilderment. I was extremely late to the meme. Indeed, they had all heard of it, and in a meager attempt to save face, I jokingly compared myself to the cave dweller of Plato. Likening my culturally aware companions to the captors of knowledge, and myself to a prisoner. My gambit paid off, stimulating a round of laughs and comparisons to frogs in wells. The night proceeded with a few callbacks as my naivety continued to shine. I have always admired the emperor’s confidence with his new clothes, and embraced the ethos behind it.\r\n\r\nGiven a few days to ponder, I’ve come to an interesting predicament, wherein I have begun to question the position of the prisoners, escapee and the wardens.\r\n\r\nThe mountain I thus stand before is as follows: Given the cave, what is the burden of knowledge? \r\n\r\nNaturally the concept of knowledge as a burden is far from novel, especially within the context of the cave. In fact, the entire purpose of the allegory culminates in this exploration, however this sense of burden is ironic. In fact, it is impossible for this burden to exist in the first place. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, Socrates through Plato describes the philosopher as the freed prisoner. I would argue that the philosopher, rather than the freed prisoner, is instead the prisoner shackled and in profuse denial. \r\n\r\nTo proceed, let us assess first the cave itself. While apt at the time, it leaves much to be desired in terms of intellectual complexity given the modern philosophical musings of the existentialists. In order to proceed, let us imagine a cave on top of a giant sphere. Such that when one exits the cave, they are thrust into a seemingly endless world. One which loops around itself. For convenience, call this Earth. Now, place earth, and the cave, inside of a simulation. Let’s call that the Matrix. Now observe the cave from the perspective of a developer or movie watcher, from outside of the matrix, and ponder each of the members of the allegory.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this elucidates my argument, but if not, consider now your own perspective, as a viewer of the matrix. Does it not plant a seed of doubt? That perhaps you are being observed too? \r\n\r\nConsider the scenario where you enter this game and explain the simulation to the people of the world. This can go one of two general directions. Either they believe you, or  they do not believe you.\r\n\r\nOption A: They believe you\r\n\r\nGiven that the people of this world believe you, what then? You have informed them of their own tragedy, and they believed you. You have relinquished your burden to the miserable sops of the matrix, and can happily return to your own reality where you exist. You continue to observe your own reality, but then someone comes to you and claims to be from outside of the matrix. Do you believe them? Given your experience, the least hypocritical response would be to believe their claims. What then? Your “savior” relinquishes their burden unto you, and you have been enlightened of the existence of the cave. Notice however, that we have encountered a tautology. By informing others of the existence of the cave, you inevitably realize that you too, are within the cave. Indeed, it is impossible to gain knowledge without feeling the tightening of the shackles around one’s wrists.\r\n\r\nSo then, at this stage, what are you?\r\n\r\nOption B: They do not believe you\r\n\r\nThe people of the matrix instead reject your revelation and you return to your world dreary and burdened. Rather than a weight lifted, you experience frustration at the inability for the people of the cave to synthesize your truth, or perhaps your own inadequacies. Now someone proposes that you too are inside of the matrix, however you reject their musings. Instead, you opt to consider your existence to be the pinnacle of realities, the upper echelon of reality, the final turtle at the bottom of the others. Again, we see a tautology, which takes a different path but ultimately results in the same outcome. \r\n\r\nAbsurdly, one will realize that ANY combination will result in a tautology, and thus position the enlightened individual as one who is shackled. Ironically too, the more knowledge they gain, the more they will become aware of their shackles. \r\n\r\nThis is my question, what are the shackles? It may seem wasteful to spend time pondering simply to arrive back where we started, but consider what we have learned.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that there is no way to prove existence to others, and that our burden is something that grows as we learn more. This is a revelation. The burden is growth. \r\n\r\nActually, it’s by no means a novel revelation. Religion frequently attempts to restrict the pursuit of knowledge. That is to say, one purpose of religion is to ward off the spiraling existentialism. What an absurd idea, that the fruit of our effort is a Sin.\r\n\r\nSo what the hell does any of this have to do with a dinner party? Before we return to that, consider an escaped prisoner once more. But imagine that this escaped prisoner never returns to the cave. When greeted by the viewer from outside the matrix, they accept it blindly. They, rather than concerned about their own existence, take delight in their shared experience. To this escapee, is it not wonderful to know that the guards were also blind? The now freed prisoner is grateful for the simulation. It’s not a shackle to the ground, but rather a link to every other conscience. They have proven that they exist, as a higher being deemed them worthy of conversation. They know this higher being will inevitably experience a similar fate, at least until the rules of the world change, ie no time.\r\n\r\nHave we not strayed further from the dinner party? In fact, we haven’t. We have arrived instead, at the laughter in the room at my own expense. The chorus of sounds which are warm colors dancing through the air. The friendship we share, and the knowledge that we come across. To strip away the shackles of the cave, one must only consider the chains to be links to other prisoners, and we are free to wander until our hearts give out.\r\n\r\n\r\n![cave](/writing/images/cave.png)\r\n"

Instead he chooses to room with me at the Rua dos Douradores. And because he was born first, my light will always cast his shadow, never to be the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n![birth](https://workers-ai.eankrenzin.workers.dev/?key=image-1702230858972.png)"
