## Simple Three.js Scene

This is a simple Three.js scene example. The HTML includes the necessary imports for Three.js and sets up a basic scene with a rotating cube. The style ensures that the canvas takes the full width of the window without any margin.

<div id="canvas-1" style="width: 100%"></div>
<script src="/scripts/cube.js" id="script-1"></script>
